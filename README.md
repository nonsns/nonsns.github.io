# Dario Rossi homepage (stripped down github.io version)

This page is a stripped down version of my (not so) old Academic page at Telecom ParisTech.
* It is intentionally minimalistic  
* It does neither host code, nor teaching material, nor datasets  (given the 1GB GitHub pages restriction)
* It is still a work in progress and is likely not fully working.
* It written in Jekyll, but locally compiled and the rendered result is pushed to GitHub (so that is supports my own ruby plugins)

You can (try to) browse it at https://nonsns.github.io
