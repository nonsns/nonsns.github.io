# nonsns.github.io

* first commit for github pages. not top priority, so will likely stay as it is for a while
* this is ment to be a test for static site generators, such as jekyill or hugo (neither is my preferred language, so still haven't made up my mind on what I should learn), to get practice before switching my current webpage (from pmwiki http://www.telecom-paristech/~drossi)
* while I'm at it, I will try to at least put useful information
