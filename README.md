# Dario Rossi homepage (stripped down github.io version)

This page is intentionally minimalistic. It is a stripped down version of my (not so) old Academic page at Telecom ParisTech. It does neither host code, nor teaching material, nor datasets. It is still a work in progress and is likely not fully working.

## Changelog

 * v1 Sep 25th, 2018 (Transition started)


## Jekyll-Bootstrap-3

Web page source for Jekyll-Bootstrap-3 also created with Jekyll-Bootstrap-3
