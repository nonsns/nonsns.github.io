<div id="ITC-18" class="collapse">
<p>Recent research has put forward the concept of Fog computing, a deported intelligence for IoT networks. Fog clusters are meant to complement current cloud deployments, providing compute and storage resources directly in the access network – which is particularly useful for low-latency applications. How- ever, Fog deployments are expected to be less elastic than cloud platforms, since elasticity in Cloud platforms comes from the scale of the data-centers. Thus, a Fog node dimensioned for the average traffic load of a given application will not be able to handle sudden bursts of traffic. In this paper, we explore such a use-case, where a Fog-based latency-sensitive application must offload some of its processing to the Cloud. We build an analytical queueing model for deriving the statistical response time of a Fog deployment under different request Load Balancing (LB) strategies, contrasting a naive, an ideal (LFU-LB, assuming a priori knowledge of the request popularity) and a practical (LRU-LB, based on online learning of the popularity with an LRU filter) scheme. Using our model, and confirming the results through simulation, we show that our LRU-LB proposal achieves close-to-ideal performance, with high savings on Cloud offload cost with respect to a request-oblivious strategy in the explored scenarios.</p>

<p>Recent technology evolution allows network equipments to continuously stream a wealth of "telemetry" information, which pertains to multiple protocols and layers of the tack, at a very fine spatial-grain and high-frequency. Processing this deluge of telemetry data in real-time clearly offers new opportunities for network control and troubleshooting, but also poses serious challenges. We tackle this challenge by applying streaming machine-learning techniques to the continuous flow of control and data-plane telemetry data, with the purpose of real-time detection of BGP anomalies. In particular, we implement an anomaly detection engine that leverages DenStream, an unsupervised clustering technique, and apply it to features collected from a large-scale testbed comprising tens of routers traversed by 1 Terabit/s worth of real application traffic. In spirit with the recent trend toward reproducibility of research results, we make our code and datasets available as open source to the scientific community</p>

<p>Page load time (PLT) is still the most common application Quality of Service (QoS) metric to estimate the Quality of Experience (QoE) of Web users. Yet, recent literature abounds with interesting proposals for alternative metrics (e.g., Above The Fold, SpeedIndex and variants) that aim at closely capturing how users perceive the Webpage rendering process. However, these novel metrics are typically computationally expensive, as they require to monitor and post-process videos of the rendering process, and have failed to be widely deployed. In this demo, we show our implementation of an open-source Chrome extension that implements a practical and lightweight method to measure the approximated Above-the-Fold (AATF) time, as well as others Web performance metrics. The idea is, instead of accurately monitoring the rendering output, to track the download time of the last visible object on screen (i.e., “above the fold”). Our plugin also has options to save detailed reports for later analysis, a functionality ideally suited for researchers wanting to gather data from Web experiments.</p>

<p>Software packet processing is an intriguing approach due to its tremendous flexibility and cost reduction compared with hardware solutions, which have long dominated software performance. However, the emergence of fast packet I/O frameworks challenges hardware supremacy, as software solutions based on commodity hardware manage to process packets at high speed (10-40 Gbps). Whereas novel packet processing applications based on these new frameworks proliferate, fine-grained traffic monitor at high speed has received comparatively less attention. In this demonstration, we showcase FlowMon-DPDK a novel software traffic monitor recently published at TMA 2018, based on the Intel DPDK I/O framework. Our monitor is capable of providing runtime statistics at both packet- and flow-levels at 10 Gbit/s using a minimal amount of CPU resources, with packet losses that are order of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art software. A video showing the demonstration is available at \urlhttps://youtu.be/B8uaw9UgMm0. For further details, please refer to our TMA 2018 paper.</p>

<p>In 2012, Google introduced the Speed Index (SI) metric to quantify the speed of the Web page visual completeness for the actually displayed above-the-fold (ATF) portion of a Web page. In Web browsing a page might appear to the user to be already fully rendered, even though further content may still be retrieved, resulting in the Page Load Time (PLT). This happens due to the browser progressively rendering all objects, part of which can also be located below the browser window’s current viewport. The SI metric (and variants) thereof have since established themselves as a de facto standard in Web page and browser testing. While SI is a step in the direction of including the user experience into Web metrics, the actual meaning of the metric and especially its relationship between Speed Index and Web QoE is however far from being clear. The contributions of this paper are thus to first develop an understanding of the SI based on a theoretical analysis and second, to analyze the interdependency between SI and MOS values from an existing public dataset. Specifically, our analysis is based on two well established models that map the user waiting time to a user ACR-rating of the QoE. The analysis show that ATF-based metrics are more appropriate than pure PLT as input to Web QoE models.</p>

Specifically, our analysis is based on two well established models that map the user waiting time to a user ACR-rating of the QoE. The analysis show that ATF-based metrics are more appropriate than pure PLT as input to Web QoE models.  </div>

<p>Testing experimental network devices requires deep performance analysis, which is usually performed with expensive, not flexible, hardware equipment. With the advent of high- speed packet I/O frameworks, general purpose equipments have narrowed the performance gap in respect of dedicated hardware and a variety of software-based solutions have emerged for handling traffic at very high speed. While the literature abounds with software traffic generators, existing monitoring solutions do not target worst-case scenarios (i.e., 64B packets at line rate) that are particularly relevant for stress-testing high-speed network functions, or occupy too many resources. In this paper we first analyze the design space for high-speed traffic monitoring that leads us to specific choices characterizing FlowMon-DPDK, a DPDK-based software traffic monitor that we make available as open source software. In a nutshell, FlowMon-DPDK provides tunable fine-grained statistics at both packet and flow levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our traffic monitor is able to provide per-flow statistics with 5-nines precision at high-speed (14.88 Mpps) using a exiguous amount of resources. Finally, we showcase FlowMon-DPDK usage by testing two open source prototypes for stateful flow-level end-host and in-network packet processing.</p>

<p>Originally used to assist network-layer fragmentation and reassembly, the IP identification field (IP-ID) has been used and abused for a range of tasks, from counting hosts behind NAT, to detect router aliases and, lately, to assist detection of censorship in the Internet at large. These inferences have been possible since, in the past, the IP- ID was mostly implemented as a simple packet counter: however, this behavior has been discouraged for security reasons and other policies, such as random values, have been suggested. In this study, we propose a framework to classify the different IP-ID behaviors using active probing from a single host. Despite being only minimally intrusive, our technique is significantly accurate (99% true positive classification) robust against packet losses (up to 20%) and lightweight (few packets suffices to discriminate all IP-ID behaviors). We then apply our technique to an Internet-wide census, where we actively probe one alive target per each routable /24 subnet: we find that that the majority of hosts adopts a constant IP-IDs (39%) or local counter (34%), that the fraction of global counters (18%) significantly diminished, that a non marginal number of hosts have an odd behavior (7%) and that random IP-IDs are still an exception (2%).</p>

<div id="Abstract-PAM-18a" class="collapse well"> Originally used to assist network-layer fragmentation and reassembly, the IP identification field (IP-ID) has been used and abused for a range of tasks, from counting hosts behind NAT, to detect router aliases and, lately, to assist detection of censorship in the Internet at large. These inferences have been possible since, in the past, the IP- ID was mostly implemented as a simple packet counter: however, this behavior has been discouraged for security reasons and other policies, such as random values, have been suggested. In this study, we propose a framework to classify the different IP-ID behaviors using active probing from a single host. Despite being only minimally intrusive, our technique is significantly accurate (99% true positive classification) robust against packet losses (up to 20%) and lightweight (few packets suffices to discriminate all IP-ID behaviors). We then apply our technique to an Internet-wide census, where we actively probe one alive target per each routable /24 subnet: we find that that the majority of hosts adopts a constant IP-IDs (39%) or local counter (34%), that the fraction of global counters (18%) significantly diminished, that a non marginal number of hosts have an odd behavior (7%) and that random IP-IDs are still an exception (2%).  </div>

<p>Page load time (PLT) is still the most common application Quality of Service (QoS) metric to estimate the Quality of Experience (QoE) of Web users.

The main purpose of this work is thus to thoroughly investigate a mapping between established and recently proposed objective metrics and user QoE. We obtain ground truth QoE via user experiments where we collect and analyze 3,400 Web accesses annotated with QoS metrics and explicit user ratings in a scale of 1 to 5, which we make available to the community. In particular, we contrast domain expert models (such as ITU-T and IQX) fed with a single QoS metric, to models trained using our ground-truth dataset over multiple QoS metrics as features. Results of our experiments show that, albeit very simple, expert models have a comparable accuracy to machine learning approaches. Furthermore, the model accuracy improves considerably when building per-page QoE models, which may raise scalability concerns as we discuss.</p>

<p>In-network caching is an appealing solution to cope with the increasing bandwidth demand of video, audio and data transfer over the Internet. Nonetheless, in order to protect consumer privacy and their own business, Content Providers (CPs) increasingly deliver encrypted content, thereby preventing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from employing traditional caching strategies, which require the knowledge of the objects being transmitted. To overcome this emerging tussle between security and effi- ciency, in this paper we propose an architecture in which the ISP partitions the cache space into slices, assigns each slice to a different CP, and lets the CPs remotely manage their slices. This architecture enables transparent caching of encrypted content, and can be deployed in the very edge of the ISP’s network (i.e., base stations, femtocells), while allowing CPs to maintain exclusive control over their content. We propose an algorithm, called SDCP, for partitioning the cache storage into slices so as to maximize the bandwidth savings provided by the cache. A distinctive feature of our algorithm is that ISPs only need to measure the aggregated miss rates of each CP, but they need not know of the individual objects that are requested. We prove that the SDCP algorithm converges to a partitioning that is close to the optimal, and we bound its optimality gap. We use simulations to evaluate SDCP’s convergence rate under stationary and non-stationary content popularity. Finally, we show that SDCP significantly outperforms traditional reactive caching techniques, considering both CPs with perfect and with imperfect knowledge of their content popularity.</p>

<p>In this paper we propose a methodology for the study of general cache networks, which is intrinsically scalable and amenable to parallel execution. We contrast two techniques: one that slices the network, and another that slices the content catalog. In the former, each core simulates requests for the whole catalog on a subgraph of the original topology, whereas in the latter each core simulates requests for a portion of the original catalog on a replica of the whole network. Interestingly, we find out that when the number of cores increases (and so the split ratio of the network topology), the overhead of message passing required to keeping consistency among nodes actually offsets any benefit from the parallelization: this is strictly due to the correlation among neighboring caches, meaning that requests arriving at one cache allocated on one core may depend on the status of one or more caches allocated on different cores. Even more interestingly, we find out that the newly proposed catalog slicing, on the contrary, achieves an ideal speedup in the number of cores. Overall, our system, which we make available as open source software, enables performance assessment of large-scale general cache networks, i.e., comprising hundreds of nodes, trillions contents, and complex routing and caching algorithms, in minutes of CPU time and with exiguous amounts of memory.</p>

<p>Streaming of video contents over the Internet is experiencing an unprecedented growth. While video permeates every application, it also puts tremendous pressure in the network – to support users having heterogeneous accesses and expecting high quality of experience, in a furthermore cost-effective manner. In this context, Future Internet (FI) paradigms, such as Information Centric Networking (ICN), are particularly well suited to not only enhance video delivery at the client (as in the DASH approach), but to also naturally and seamlessly extend video support deeper in the network functions. In this paper, we contrast ICN and TCP/IP with an experimental approach, where we employ several state-of-the-art DASH controllers (PANDA, AdapTech, and BOLA) on an ICN vs TCP/IP network stack. Our campaign, based on tools which we developed and made available as open-source software, includes multiple clients (homogeneous vs heterogeneous mixture, synchronous vs asynchronous arrivals), videos (up to 4K resolution), channels (e.g., DASH profiles, emulated WiFi and LTE, real 3G/4G traces), and levels of integration with an ICN network (i.e., vanilla NDN, wireless loss detection and recovery at the access point, load balancing).

<p>Two concurrent factors challenge the evaluation of large-scale cache networks: complex algorithmic interactions, which are hardly represented by analytical models, and catalog/network size, which limits the scalability of event-driven simulations. To solve these limitations, we propose a new hybrid technique, that we colloquially refer to as ModelGraft, which combines elements of stochastic analysis within a simulative Monte-Carlo approach. In ModelGraft, large scenarios are mapped to a downscaled counterpart built upon Time-To-Live (TTL) caches, to achieve CPU and memory scalability. Additionally, a feedback loop ensures convergence to a consistent state, whose performance accurately represent those of the original system. Finally, the technique also retains simulation simplicity and flexibility, as it can be seamlessly applied to numerous forwarding, meta-caching, and replacement algorithms. We implement and make ModelGraft available as an alternative simulation engine of ccnSim. Performance evaluation shows that, with respect to classic event-driven simulation, ModelGraft gains over two orders of magnitude in both CPU time and memory complexity, while limiting accuracy loss below 2%. Ultimately, ModelGraft pushes the boundaries of the performance evaluation well beyond the limits achieved in the current state of the art, enabling the study of Internet-scale scenarios with content catalogs comprising hundreds billions objects.</p>

<p>	This work focuses on the evaluation of Web quality of experience as perceived by actual users and in particular on the impact of HTTP/1 vs HTTP/2. We adopt an experimental methodology that uses real web pages served through a realistic testbed where we control network, protocol, and application configuration. Users are asked to browse such pages and provide their subjective feedback, which we leverage to obtain the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while the testbed records objective metrics. The collected dataset comprises over 4,000 grades that we explore to tackle the question whether HTTP/2 improves users experience, to what extent, and in which conditions. Findings show that users report marginal differences, with 22%, 52%, 26% of HTTP/2 MOS being better, identical, or worse than HTTP/1, respectively. Even in scenarios that favor HTTP/2, results are not as sharp as expected. This is in contrast with objective metrics, which instead record a positive impact with HTTP/2 usage. This shows the complexity of understanding the web experience and the need to involve actual users in the quality assessment process.</p>

<div id="Abstract-PAM-17" class="collapse well"> 	This work focuses on the evaluation of Web quality of experience as perceived by actual users and in particular on the impact of HTTP/1 vs HTTP/2. We adopt an experimental methodology that uses real web pages served through a realistic testbed where we control network, protocol, and application configuration. Users are asked to browse such pages and provide their subjective feedback, which we leverage to obtain the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while the testbed records objective metrics. The collected dataset comprises over 4,000 grades that we explore to tackle the question whether HTTP/2 improves users experience, to what extent, and in which conditions. Findings show that users report marginal differences, with 22%, 52%, 26% of HTTP/2 MOS being better, identical, or worse than HTTP/1, respectively. Even in scenarios that favor HTTP/2, results are not as sharp as expected. This is in contrast with objective metrics, which instead record a positive impact with HTTP/2 usage. This shows the complexity of understanding the web experience and the need to involve actual users in the quality assessment process.  </div>

<p>In recent years, the progress in both hardware and software allows user-space applications to capture packets at 10 Gb/s line rate or more, with cheap COTS hardware. However, processing packets at such rates with software is still far from being trivial. In the literature, this challenge has been extensively studied for network intrusion detection systems, where per-packet operations are easy to parallelize with support of hardware acceleration. Conversely, the scalability of statistical traffic analyzers (STAs) is intrinsically complicated by the need to track per-flow state to collect statistics. This challenge has received less attention so far, and it is the focus of this work. We present and discuss design choices to enable a STA to collects hundreds of per-flow metrics at a multi-10-Gb/s line rate. We leverage a handful of hardware advancements proposed over the last years (e.g., RSS queues, NUMA architecture), and we provide insights on the trade-offs they imply when combined with state-of-the-art packet capture libraries and the multi-process paradigm. We outline the principles to design an optimized STA, and we implement them to engineer DPDKStat, a solution combining the Intel DPDK framework with the traffic analyzer Tstat.

<p>In-network caching is an appealing solution to cope with the increasing bandwidth demand of video, audio and data transfer over the Internet. Nonetheless, an increasing share of content delivery services adopt encryption through HTTPS, which is not compatible with traditional ISP-managed approaches like transparent and proxy caching. This raises the need for solutions involving both Internet Service Providers (ISP) and Content Providers (CP): by design, the solution should preserve business-critical CP information (e.g., content popularity, user preferences) on the one hand, while allowing for a deeper integration of caches in the ISP architecture (e.g., in 5G femto-cells) on the other hand. In this paper we address this issue by considering a contentoblivious ISP-operated cache. The ISP allocates the cache storage to various content providers so as to maximize the bandwidth savings provided by the cache: the main novelty lies in the fact that, to protect business-critical information, ISPs only need to measure the aggregated miss rates of the individual CPs and does not need to be aware of the objects that are requested, as in classic caching. We propose a cache allocation algorithm based on a perturbed stochastic subgradient method, and prove that the algorithm converges close to the allocation that maximizes the overall cache hit rate. We use extensive simulations to validate the algorithm and to assess its convergence rate under stationary and non-stationary content popularity. Our results (i) testify the feasibility of content-oblivious caches and (ii) show that the proposed algorithm can achieve within 10% from the global optimum in our evaluation.</p>

<p>Large scale deployments of general cache networks, such as Content Delivery Networks or Information Centric Networking architectures, arise new challenges regarding their performance evaluation for network planning. On the one hand, analytical models can hardly represent in details all the interactions of complex replacement, replication, and routing policies on arbitrary topologies. On the other hand, the sheer size of networks and content catalogs makes event-driven simulation techniques inherently non-scalable. We propose a new technique for the performance evaluation of large-scale caching systems that intelligently integrates elements of stochastic analysis within a MonteCarlo simulative approach, that we colloquially refer to as ModelGraft. Our approach (i) leverages the intuition that complex scenarios can be mapped to a simpler equivalent scenario that builds upon Time-To-Live (TTL) caches; it (ii) significantly downscales the scenario to lower computation and memory complexity, while, at the same time, preserving its properties to limit accuracy loss; finally, it (iii) is simple to use and robust, as it autonomously converges to a consistent state through a feedback-loop control system, regardless of the initial state. Performance evaluation shows that, with respect to classic event-driven simulation, ModelGraft gains over two orders of magnitude in both CPU time and memory complexity, while limiting accuracy loss below 2%. In addition, we show that ModelGraft extends performance evaluation well beyond the boundaries of classic approaches, by enabling study of Internet-scale scenarios with content catalogs comprising hundreds of billions objects.</p>

<p>Recently, a negative interplay has been shown to arise when scheduling/Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques and low-priority congestion control protocols are used together; namely, AQM resets the relative level of priority among congestion control protocols. This work explores this issue by carrying out a control-theoretic analysis of the dynamical system to prove some fundamental properties that fully characterize the reprioritization phenomenon. In particular, (i) we provide the closed-form solution of the equilibrium in the open loop (i.e., fixing a target loss probability p); (ii) we provide a stability analysis and a characterization of the reprioritization phenomenon when closing the loop with AQM (i.e., that dynamically adjusts the system loss probability). Our results are important as the characterization of the reprioritization phenomenon is not only quantitatively accurate for the specific protocols and AQM considered but also qualitatively accurate for a broader range of congestion control protocol and AQM combinations. Finally, while we find a sufficient condition to avoid the reprioritization phenomenon, we also show, at the same time, such conditions to be likely impractical: Therefore, we propose a simple and practical system-level solution that is able to reinstate priorities among protocols.</p>

<p>Use of IP-layer anycast has increased in the last few years beyond the DNS realm. Yet, existing measurement techniques to identify and enumerate anycast replicas exploit specifics of the DNS protocol, which limits their applicability to this particular service. With this paper, we not only propose and thoroughly validate a protocol-agnostic technique for anycast replicas discovery and geolocation, but also provide the community with open source software and datasets to replicate our experimental results, as well as facilitating the development of new techniques such as ours. In particular, our proposed method achieves thorough enumer-ation and city-level geolocalization of anycast instances from a set of known vantage points. The algorithm features an iterative workflow, pipelining enumeration (an optimization problem using latency as input) and geolocalization (a classification problem using side channel information such as city population) of anycast replicas. Results of a thorough validation campaign show our algorithm to be robust to measurement noise, and very lightweight as it requires only a handful of latency measurements.</p>

<p>Growing network complexity mandates automated tools and methodologies for troubleshooting. In this paper, we follow a crowd-sourcing trend and argue for the need to deploy measurement probes at the edge of the network, which can be either under the control of the users (e.g., end-user devices) or the ISP (e.g., home gateways), and that raises an interesting tradeoff. Our first contribution consists in the definition of a framework for network troubleshooting, and its implementation as open source software named NetProbes. In data mining terms, depending on the amount of information available to the probes (e.g., ISP topology), we formalize the network troubleshooting task as either a clustering or a classification problem. In networking terms, these algorithms allow respectively end-users to assess the severity of the network performance degradation, and ISPs to precisely identify the faulty link. We solve both problems with an algorithm that achieves perfect classification under the assumption of a strategic selection of probes (e.g., assisted by an ISP), and assess its performance degradation under a naive random selection. Our algorithm is generic, as it is agnostic to the network performance metrics; scalable, as it requires firing only few measurement events and simple processing; flexible, as clustering and classification stages are pipelined, so that the execution naturally adapts to the information available at the vantage point where the probe is deployed; and reliable, as it produces results that match the expectations of simple analytical models. Our second contribution consists in a careful evaluation of the framework. Previous work on network troubleshooting has so far tackled the problem with either more theoretical or more practical approaches: inherently, evaluation methodologies lack either realism or control. In this paper, we counter this problem by conducting controlled experiments with a rigorous and reproducible methodology that contrasts expectations yielded by analytical models to the experimental results gathered running our NetProbes software in the Mininet emulator. As integral part of our methodology, we perform a thorough calibration of the measurement tools employed by NetProbes to measure two example metrics of interest, namely delay and bandwidth: we show this step to be crucial, as otherwise significant biases in the measurements techniques could lead to wrong assessment of algorithmic performance. Albeit our NetProbes software is far from being a carrier-grade solution for network troubleshooting (since it does not consider neither multiple contemporary measurements, nor multiple failures, and given that we experiment with a limited number of metrics), our controlled study allows making several interesting observation that help designing such an automated troubleshooting system. 	</p>

<p>Research interest on Information Centric Networking (ICN) has been sharply growing.

Then, inspired by similar works related to the P2P field, it surveys related research papers to qualify the ICN literature produced so far, finding that a large fraction of contributions either uses custom, proprietary, and unavailable software, or even plainly fails to mention any information in this regard. By adopting a rigorous methodology, in the second part of the paper four simulators, namely ndnSIM, ccnSim, CCNPL-Sim, and Icarus, are cross-compared under several key aspects. Our findings confirm both their accuracy with respect to reference theoretical models in simple settings, and their consistency in more complex scenario.

<p>Use of IP-layer anycast has increased in the last few years: once relegated to DNS root and top-level domain servers, anycast is now commonly used to assist distribution of general purpose content by CDN providers. Yet, the measurement techniques for discovering anycast replicas have been designed around DNS, limiting their usefulness to this particular service. This raises the need for protocol agnostic methodologies, that should additionally be as lightweight as possible in order to scale up anycast service discovery. This is precisely the aim of this paper, which proposes a new method for exhaustive and accurate enumeration and city-level geolocation of anycast instances, requiring only a handful of latency measurements from a set of known vantage points. Our method exploits an iterative workflow that enumerates (an optimization problem) and geolocates (a classification problem) anycast replicas. We thoroughly validate our methodology on available ground truth (several DNS root servers), using multiple measurement infrastructures (PlanetLab, RIPE), obtaining extremely accurate results (even with simple algorithms, that we compare with the global optimum), that we make available to the scientific community. Compared to the state of the art work that appeared in INFOCOM 2013 and IMC 2013, our technique (i) is not bound to a specific protocol, (ii) requires 1000 times fewer vantage points, not only (iii) achieves over 50% recall but also (iv) accurately identifies the city-level geolocation for over 78% of the enumerated servers, with (v) a mean geolocation error of 361 km for all enumerated servers.</p>

In our recent work, we remedy to this by developing an anycast detection, enumeration, and geolocation technique based on a set of delay measurements from a handful of geographically distributed vantage points. The technique (i) detects if an IP is anycast, (ii) enumerates replicas by finding the maximum set of non-overlapping disks (i.e., areas centered around vantage points), and (iii) geolocates the replicas by solving a classification problem and assigning the server location to the most likely city.

<p>Passive probes continuously generate statistics on large number of metrics, that are possibly represented as probability mass functions (pmf). The need for consolidation of several pmfs arises in two contexts, namely: (i) whenever a central point collects and aggregates measurement of multiple disjoint vantage points, and (ii) whenever a local measurement processed at a single vantage point needs to be distributed over multiple cores of the same physical probe, in order to cope with growing link capacity. In this work, we take an experimental approach and study both cases using, whenever possible, open source software and datasets. Considering different consolidation strategies, we assess their accuracy in estimating pmf deciles (from the 10th to the 90th) of diverse metrics, obtaining general design and tuning guidelines. In our dataset, we find that Monotonic Spline Interpolation over a larger set of percentiles (e.g., adding 5th, 10th, 15th, and so on) allow fairly accurate pmf consolidation in both the multiple vantage points (median error is about 1%, maximum 30%) and local processes (median 0.1%, maximum 1%) cases.</p>

<p>In this paper, we propose a lightweight method for detecting and classifying BitTorrent content providers with a minimal amount of resources. While heavy methodologies are typically used (which require long term observation and data exchange with peers of the swarm and/or a semantic analysis of torrent websites), we instead argue that such complexity can be avoided by analyzing the correlations between peers and torrents. We apply our methodology to study over 50K torrents injected in ThePirateBay during one month, collecting more than 400K IPs addresses. Shortly, we find that exploiting the correlations not only enhances the classification accuracy keeping the technique lightweight (our methodology reliably identifies about 150 seedboxes), but also uncovers seeding behaviors that were not previously noticed (e.g., as multi-port and multi-host seeding). Finally, we correlate the popularity of seedbox hosting in our dataset to criteria (e.g., cost, storage space, Web popularity) that can bias the selection process of BitTorrent content providers.</p>

<div id="Abstract-TMA-14c" class="collapse well"> In this paper, we propose a lightweight method for detecting and classifying BitTorrent content providers with a minimal amount of resources. While heavy methodologies are typically used (which require long term observation and data exchange with peers of the swarm and/or a semantic analysis of torrent websites), we instead argue that such complexity can be avoided by analyzing the correlations between peers and torrents. We apply our methodology to study over 50K torrents injected in ThePirateBay during one month, collecting more than 400K IPs addresses. Shortly, we find that exploiting the correlations not only enhances the classification accuracy keeping the technique lightweight (our methodology reliably identifies about 150 seedboxes), but also uncovers seeding behaviors that were not previously noticed (e.g., as multi-port and multi-host seeding).

<div id="COMNET-14a" class="collapse">
<p>BitTorrent, one of the most widespread file-sharing P2P applications, recently introduced LEDBAT, a novel congestion control protocol aiming at (i) limiting the additional delay due to queuing, to reduce interference with the rest of user traffic (e.g., Web, VoIP and gaming) sharing the same access bottleneck, and (ii) efficiently using the available link capacity, to provide users with good BitTorrent performance at the same time. In this work, we adopt two complementary perspectives: namely, a flow viewpoint to assess the Quality of Service (QoS) as in classic congestion control studies, and a BitTorrent swarm viewpoint to assess peer-to-peer users Quality of Experience (QoE). We additionally point out that congestion control literature is rich of protocols, such as VEGAS, LP, and NICE sharing similarities with LEDBAT, that is therefore mandatory to consider in the analysis. Hence, adopting the above viewpoints we both (i) contrast LEDBAT to the other protocols and (ii) provide deep understanding of the novel protocol and its implication on QoS and QoE. Our simulation based investigation yields several insights. At flow-level, we gather LEDBAT to be lowest priority among all protocols, which follows from its design that strives to explicitly bound the queuing delay at the bottleneck link to a maximum target value. At the same time, we see that this very same protocol parameter can be exploited by adversaries, that can set a higher target to gain an unfair advantage over competitors. Interestingly, swarm-level performance exhibit an opposite trade-off, with smaller targets being more advantageous for QoE of BitTorrent users. This can be explained with the fact that larger delay targets slow down BitTorrent signaling task, with possibly negative effect on the swarming protocol efficiency. Additionally, we see that for the above reason, in heterogeneous swarms, any delay-based protocol (i.e., not only LEDBAT but also VEGAS or NICE) can yield a competitive QoE advantage over loss-based TCP. Overall this tension between swarm and flow-levels suggests that, at least in current ADSL/cable access bottleneck scenarios, a safe LEDBAT operational point may be used in practice. At the same time, our results also point out that benefits similar to LEDBAT can also be gathered with other delay-based protocols such as VEGAS or NICE.</p>

Under both approaches, promising advances have been made in recent times: notable examples are CoDel for AQM, and LEDBAT for LPCC. In this paper, we warn of a potentially fateful interaction when AQM and LPCC techniques are combined: namely, AQM resets the relative level of priority between best-effort and low-priority congestion control protocols. We validate the generality of our findings by an extended set of experiments with packet-level ns2 simulation, considering 5 AQM techniques and 3 LPCC protocols, and carry on a thorough sensitivity analysis varying several parameters of the networking scenario. We complete the simulation via an experimental campaign conducted on both controlled testbeds and on the Internet, confirming the reprioritization issue to hold in the real world at least under all combination of AQM policies and LPCC protocols available in the Linux kernel.

A first case study presents the tracking and iterative analysis of cache selection policies in Akamai, while a second example focuses on the cooperation between Internet service providers and content delivery networks to better orchestrate their traffic engineering decisions and jointly improve their performance.  </div>

Our analysis shows that, as the dataset continuously evolves (i) a steady state description is not statistically meaningful and (ii) despite the cache hit ratio decreases due to the growth of active movies in the catalog, simple caching replacement approaches are close to the optimum given the growing skew in the popularity distribution over the time.

<p>In this paper, we address the trade-off between the data plane efficiency and the control plane timeliness for the BitTorrent performance. We argue that loss-based congestion control protocols can fill large buffers, leading to a higher end-to-end delay, unlike low-priority or delay-based congestion control protocols. We perform experiments for both the uTorrent and mainline BitTorrent clients, and we study the impact of uTP (a novel transport protocol proposed by BitTorrent) and several TCP congestion control algorithms (Cubic, New Reno, LP, Vegas and Nice) on the download completion time. Briefly, in case peers in the swarm all use the same congestion control algorithm, we observe that the specific algorithm has only a limited impact on the swarm performance. Conversely, when a mix of TCP congestion control algorithms coexists, peers employing a delay-based low-priority algorithm exhibit shorter completion time.</p>

<p>Recently, the \u201cbufferbloat\u201d term has been coined to describe very large queuing delays (up to several seconds) experienced by Internet users. This problem has pushed protocol designer to deploy alternative (delay-based) models to the standard (lossbased) TCP best effort congestion control. In this work, we exploit timestamp information carried in the LEDBAT header, a protocol proposed by BitTorrent as replacement for TCP data transfer, to infer the queuing delay suffered by remote hosts. We conduct a thorough measurement campaign, that let us conclude that (i) LEDBAT delay-based congestion control is effective in keeping the queuing delay low for the bulk of the peers, (ii) yet about 1% of peers often experience queuing delay in excess of 1s, and (iii) not only the network access type, but also the BitTorrent client and the operating system concurr in determining the bufferbloat magnitude.</p>

<p>Nowadays, due to excessive queuing, delays on the Internet can grow longer than several round trips between the Moon and the Earth, for which the "bufferbloat" term was recently coined. Some point to active queue management (AQM) as the solution. Others propose end-to-end low-priority congestion control techniques (LPCC). Under both approaches, promising advances have been made in recent times: notable examples are CoDel for AQM, and LEDBAT for LPCC. In this paper, we warn of a potentially fateful interaction when AQM and LPCC techniques are combined: namely (i) AQM resets the relative level of priority between best effort and low-priority congestion control protocols; (ii) while reprioritization generally equalizes the priority of LPCC and TCP, we also find that some AQM settings may actually lead best effort TCP to starvation. By an extended set of experiments conducted on both controlled testbeds and on the Internet, we show the problem to hold in the real world for all tested combination of AQM policies and LPCC protocols. To further validate the generality of our findings, we complement our experiments with packet-level simulation, to cover cases of other popular AQM and LPCC that are not available in the Linux kernel. To promote cross-comparison, we make our scripts and dataset available to the research community.</p>

<p>Bufferbloat is the growth in buffer size that has led Internet delays to occasionally exceed the light propagation delay from the Earth to the Moon.

<p>Information Centric Networking is a new communication paradigm where network primitives are based on named-data rather than host identifiers. In ICN, data retrieval is triggered by user requests which are forwarded towards a copy of the desired content item. Data can be retrieved either from a server that permanently provides a content item, or from a temporary item copy opportunistically cached by an in-network node. As the availability of cached items dynamically varies over time, the request forwarding scheme should be adapted accordingly. In this paper we focus on dynamic request forwarding in ICN, and develop an approach, inspired by Q-routing framework, that we show to outperform algorithms currently available in the state of the art.</p>

<p>Content Centric Networking (CCN) is a promising architecture for the diffusion of popular content over the Internet. While CCN system design is sound, gathering a reliable estimate of its performance in the current Internet is challenging, due to the large scale and to the lack of agreement in some critical elements of the evaluation scenario. In this work, we add a number of important pieces to the CCN puzzle by means of a chunk-level simulator that we make available to the scientific community as open source software. First, we pay special attention to the locality of the user request process, as it may be determined by user interest or language barrier. Second, we consider the existence of possibly multiple repositories for the same content, as in the current Internet, along with different CCN interest forwarding policies, exploiting either a single or multiple repositories in parallel. To widen the relevance of our findings, we consider multi- ple topologies, content popularity settings, caching replacement policies and CCN forwarding strategies. Summarizing our main result, though the use of multiple content repositories can be beneficial from the user point of view, it may however counter part of the benefits if the CCN strategy layer implements naive interest forwarding policies.</p>

<p>This work addresses the performance evaluation of Content Centric Networks (CCN). Focusing on a realistic YouTube-like catalog, we conduct a very thorough simulation study of the main system performance, consider several ingredients such as network topology, multi-path routing, content popularity, caching decisions and replacement policies. Summarizing our main results, we gather that (i) the impact of the topology is limited, (ii) multi-path routing may play against CCN efficiency, (iii) simple randomized policies perform almost as well as more complex ones, (iv) catalog and popularity settings play by far the most crucial role above all.

<p>In this work, we study the caching performance of Content Centric Networking (CCN), with special emphasis on the size of individual CCN router caches. Specifically, we consider several graph-related centrality metrics (e.g., betweenness, closeness, stress, graph, eccentricity and degree centralities) to allocate content store space heterogeneously across the CCN network, and contrast the performance to that of an homogeneous allocation. To gather relevant results, we study CCN caching performance under large cache sizes (individual content stores of 10 GB), realistic topologies (up to 60 nodes), a YouTube-like Internet catalog (108 files for 1PB video data). A thorough simulation campaign allow us to conclude that (i) , the gain brought by content store size heterogeneity is very limited, and that (ii) the simplest metric, namely degree centrality, already proves to be a “sufficiently good” allocation criterion. On the one hand, this implies rather simple rules of thumb for the content store sizing (e.g., “if you add a line card to a CCN router, add some content store space as well”). On the other hand, we point out that technological constraints, such as line- speed operation requirement, may however limit the applicability of degree-based content store allocation.</p>

<p>Research interest about Information Centric Networking (ICN) has grown at a very fast pace over the last few years, especially after the 2009 seminal paper of Van Jacobson et al. describing a Content Centric Network (CCN) architecture. While significant research effort has been produced in terms of architectures, algorithms, and models, the scientific community currently lacks common tools and scenarios to allow a fair cross- comparison among the different proposals. The situation is particularly complex as the commonly used general-purpose simulators cannot cope with the expected system scale: thus, many proposals are currently evaluated over small and unrealistic scale, especially in terms of dominant factors like catalog and cache sizes. As such, there is need of a scalable tool under which different algorithms can be tested and compared. Over the last years, we have developed and optimized ccnSim, an highly scalable chunk-level simulator especially suitable for the analysis of caching performance of CCN network. In this paper, we briefly describe the tool, and present an extensive benchmark of its performance. To give an idea of ccnSim scalability, a common off-the-shelf PC equipped with 8GB of RAM memory is able to simulate 2-hours of a 50-nodes CCN network, where each nodes is equipped with 10 GB caches, serving a 1 PB catalog in about 20 min CPU time.</p>

<div id="PPNA-13" class="collapse">
<p>In the Internet, user-level performance of P2P applications may be determined by the interaction of two independent dynamics: on the one hand, by the end-to-end control policies applied at the P2P application layer (L7); on the other hand, by Traffic Engineering (TE) decisions taken at the network level (L3). Currently available tools do not allow to study L7/L3 interactions in realistic settings due to a number of limitations. Building over ModelNet, we develop a framework for the real-time emulation of TE capabilities, named ModelNet-TE, that we make available to the scientific community as open source software. ModelNet-TE allows (i) to deploy real unmodified Internet P2P applications, and to test their interaction with (ii) many TE algorithms, as its design allows to easily integrate other TE algorithms than those we already provide, (iii) in a furthermore controlled network environment. Due to these features, ModelNet-TE is a complementary tool with respect to hybrid simulation/protoyping toolkits (that constrain application development to a specific language and framework, and cannot be used with existing or proprietary applications) and to other open testbeds such as PlanetLab or Grid5000 (lacking of control or TE-capabilities respectively). ModelNet-TE can thus be useful to L7-researchers, as it allows to seamlessly and transparently test any existing P2P application without requiring any software modification. At the same time, ModelNet-TE can be useful to L3-researchers as well, since they can test their TE algorithms on the traffic generated by real applications. As a use case, in this work we carry on an experimental campaign of L7/L3 routing layers interaction through ModelNet-TE. As TE we consider the classic minimum congestion load-balancing, that we compare against standard IP routing. As example P2P applications, we take BitTorrent, one among the most popular file-sharing applications nowadays, and WineStreamer, an open source live-streaming application. We emulate BitTorrent and WineStreamer swarms over both realistic topologies (e.g., Abilene) and simplistic topologies that are commonly in use today (e.g., where the bottleneck is located at the network edge) under a variety of scenarios. Results of our experimental campaign show that user-level performance may be significantly affected by both the TE mechanism in use at L3 (e.g., due to interactions with TCP congestion control or P2P chunk trading logic), as well as scenario parameters that are difficult to control in the wild Internet, which thus testifies the interest for tools such as ModelNet-TE.</p>

<p>Internet video and peer-to-peer television (P2P-TV) are attracting more and more users: chances are that P2P-TV is going to be the next Internet killer application. In recent years, valuable effort has been devoted to the problems of chunk-scheduling and overlay management in P2P-TV systems. However, many interesting P2P-TV proposals have been evaluated either in rather idealistic environments, or in the wild Internet. Our work sits in between these two antipodean approaches: our aim is to compare existing systems in a controlled way, but taking special care in realistic conditions for their evaluation at the same time. We carry on a simulation analysis that considers several factors, modeling the L7 overlay (e.g., chunk scheduling, topology management, overlay topology, etc.), the L3 network (e.g., end-to-end latency models, fixed vs dynamic conditions, etc.), and the interaction of both layers (e.g., measurement errors, loss of signaling messages, etc.). To depict a comprenshive system view, results are expressed in terms of both user-centric and network-centric metrics. In a nuthshell, our main finding is that P2P-TV systems are generally robust against measurement errors (e.g., propagation delay or capacity estimation), but are on the contrary deeply affected by signaling errors (e.g., loss or outdated system view), which are often overlooked without justification.</p>

<div id="PAM-18a" class="collapse">
<p>Originally used to assist network-layer fragmentation and reassembly, the IP identification field (IP-ID) has been used and abused for a range of tasks, from counting hosts behind NAT, to detect router aliases and, lately, to assist detection of censorship in the Internet at large. These inferences have been possible since, in the past, the IP- ID was mostly implemented as a simple packet counter: however, this behavior has been discouraged for security reasons and other policies, such as random values, have been suggested. In this study, we propose a framework to classify the different IP-ID behaviors using active probing from a single host. Despite being only minimally intrusive, our technique is significantly accurate (99% true positive classification) robust against packet losses (up to 20%) and lightweight (few packets suffices to discriminate all IP-ID behaviors). We then apply our technique to an Internet-wide census, where we actively probe one alive target per each routable /24 subnet: we find that that the majority of hosts adopts a constant IP-IDs (39%) or local counter (34%), that the fraction of global counters (18%) significantly diminished, that a non marginal number of hosts have an odd behavior (7%) and that random IP-IDs are still an exception (2%).</p>

<p>In the Internet, Autonomous Systems continuously exchange routing information via the BGP protocol: the large number of networks involved and the verbosity of BGP result in a huge stream of updates. Making sense of all those messages remains a challenge today. In this paper, we leverage the notion of "primary path" (i.e., the most used inter-domain path of a BGP router toward a destination prefix for a given time period), reinterpreting updates by grouping them in terms of primary paths unavailability periods, and illustrate how BGP dynamics analysis would benefit from working with primary paths. Our contributions are as follows. First, through measurements, we validate the existence of primary paths: by analyzing BGP updates announced at the LINX RIS route collector spanning a three months period, we show that primary paths are consistently in use during the observation period. Second, we quantify the benefits of primary paths for BGP dynamics analysis on two use cases : Internet tomography and anomaly detection. For the latter, using three months of anomalous BGP events documented by BGPmon as reference, we show that primary paths could be used for detecting such events (hijacks and outages), testifying of the increased semantic they provide.</p>

<p>In-network caching is an appealing solution to cope with the increasing bandwidth demand of video, audio and data transfer over the Internet. Nonetheless, in order to protect consumer privacy and their own business, Content Providers (CPs) increasingly deliver encrypted content, thereby preventing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from employing traditional caching strategies, which require the knowledge of the objects being transmitted. To overcome this emerging tussle between security and effi- ciency, in this paper we propose an architecture in which the ISP partitions the cache space into slices, assigns each slice to a different CP, and lets the CPs remotely manage their slices. This architecture enables transparent caching of encrypted content, and can be deployed in the very edge of the ISP’s network (i.e., base stations, femtocells), while allowing CPs to maintain exclusive control over their content. We propose an algorithm, called SDCP, for partitioning the cache storage into slices so as to maximize the bandwidth savings provided by the cache. A distinctive feature of our algorithm is that ISPs only need to measure the aggregated miss rates of each CP, but they need not know of the individual objects that are requested. We prove that the SDCP algorithm converges to a partitioning that is close to the optimal, and we bound its optimality gap. We use simulations to evaluate SDCP’s convergence rate under stationary and non-stationary content popularity. Finally, we show that SDCP significantly outperforms traditional reactive caching techniques, considering both CPs with perfect and with imperfect knowledge of their content popularity.</p>

<p>Streaming of video contents over the Internet is experiencing an unprecedented growth. While video permeates every application, it also puts tremendous pressure in the network – to support users having heterogeneous accesses and expecting high quality of experience, in a furthermore cost-effective manner. In this context, Future Internet (FI) paradigms, such as Information Centric Networking (ICN), are particularly well suited to not only enhance video delivery at the client (as in the DASH approach), but to also naturally and seamlessly extend video support deeper in the network functions. In this paper, we contrast ICN and TCP/IP with an experimental approach, where we employ several state-of-the-art DASH controllers (PANDA, AdapTech, and BOLA) on an ICN vs TCP/IP network stack. Our campaign, based on tools which we developed and made available as open-source software, includes multiple clients (homogeneous vs heterogeneous mixture, synchronous vs asynchronous arrivals), videos (up to 4K resolution), channels (e.g., DASH profiles, emulated WiFi and LTE, real 3G/4G traces), and levels of integration with an ICN network (i.e., vanilla NDN, wireless loss detection and recovery at the access point, load balancing). Our results clearly illustrate, as well as quantitatively assess, benefits of ICN-based streaming, warning about potential pitfalls that are however easy to avoid.</p>

<p>Two concurrent factors challenge the evaluation of large-scale cache networks: complex algorithmic interactions, which are hardly represented by analytical models, and catalog/network size, which limits the scalability of event-driven simulations. To solve these limitations, we propose a new hybrid technique, that we colloquially refer to as ModelGraft, which combines elements of stochastic analysis within a simulative Monte-Carlo approach. In ModelGraft, large scenarios are mapped to a downscaled counterpart built upon Time-To-Live (TTL) caches, to achieve CPU and memory scalability. Additionally, a feedback loop ensures convergence to a consistent state, whose performance accurately represent those of the original system. Finally, the technique also retains simulation simplicity and flexibility, as it can be seamlessly applied to numerous forwarding, meta-caching, and replacement algorithms. We implement and make ModelGraft available as an alternative simulation engine of ccnSim. Performance evaluation shows that, with respect to classic event-driven simulation, ModelGraft gains over two orders of magnitude in both CPU time and memory complexity, while limiting accuracy loss below 2%. Ultimately, ModelGraft pushes the boundaries of the performance evaluation well beyond the limits achieved in the current state of the art, enabling the study of Internet-scale scenarios with content catalogs comprising hundreds billions objects.</p>

<p>	This work focuses on the evaluation of Web quality of experience as perceived by actual users and in particular on the impact of HTTP/1 vs HTTP/2. We adopt an experimental methodology that uses real web pages served through a realistic testbed where we control network, protocol, and application configuration. Users are asked to browse such pages and provide their subjective feedback, which we leverage to obtain the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while the testbed records objective metrics. The collected dataset comprises over 4,000 grades that we explore to tackle the question whether HTTP/2 improves users experience, to what extent, and in which conditions. Findings show that users report marginal differences, with 22%, 52%, 26% of HTTP/2 MOS being better, identical, or worse than HTTP/1, respectively. Even in scenarios that favor HTTP/2, results are not as sharp as expected. This is in contrast with objective metrics, which instead record a positive impact with HTTP/2 usage. This shows the complexity of understanding the web experience and the need to involve actual users in the quality assessment process.</p>

<p>In recent years, the progress in both hardware and software allows user-space applications to capture packets at 10 Gb/s line rate or more, with cheap COTS hardware. However, processing packets at such rates with software is still far from being trivial. In the literature, this challenge has been extensively studied for network intrusion detection systems, where per-packet operations are easy to parallelize with support of hardware acceleration. Conversely, the scalability of statistical traffic analyzers (STAs) is intrinsically complicated by the need to track per-flow state to collect statistics. This challenge has received less attention so far, and it is the focus of this work. We present and discuss design choices to enable a STA to collects hundreds of per-flow metrics at a multi-10-Gb/s line rate. We leverage a handful of hardware advancements proposed over the last years (e.g., RSS queues, NUMA architecture), and we provide insights on the trade-offs they imply when combined with state-of-the-art packet capture libraries and the multi-process paradigm. We outline the principles to design an optimized STA, and we implement them to engineer DPDKStat, a solution combining the Intel DPDK framework with the traffic analyzer Tstat.

<p>In-network caching is an appealing solution to cope with the increasing bandwidth demand of video, audio and data transfer over the Internet. Nonetheless, an increasing share of content delivery services adopt encryption through HTTPS, which is not compatible with traditional ISP-managed approaches like transparent and proxy caching. This raises the need for solutions involving both Internet Service Providers (ISP) and Content Providers (CP): by design, the solution should preserve business-critical CP information (e.g., content popularity, user preferences) on the one hand, while allowing for a deeper integration of caches in the ISP architecture (e.g., in 5G femto-cells) on the other hand. In this paper we address this issue by considering a contentoblivious ISP-operated cache. The ISP allocates the cache storage to various content providers so as to maximize the bandwidth savings provided by the cache: the main novelty lies in the fact that, to protect business-critical information, ISPs only need to measure the aggregated miss rates of the individual CPs and does not need to be aware of the objects that are requested, as in classic caching. We propose a cache allocation algorithm based on a perturbed stochastic subgradient method, and prove that the algorithm converges close to the allocation that maximizes the overall cache hit rate. We use extensive simulations to validate the algorithm and to assess its convergence rate under stationary and non-stationary content popularity. Our results (i) testify the feasibility of content-oblivious caches and (ii) show that the proposed algorithm can achieve within 10% from the global optimum in our evaluation.</p>

<p>Large scale deployments of general cache networks, such as Content Delivery Networks or Information Centric Networking architectures, arise new challenges regarding their performance evaluation for network planning. On the one hand, analytical models can hardly represent in details all the interactions of complex replacement, replication, and routing policies on arbitrary topologies. On the other hand, the sheer size of networks and content catalogs makes event-driven simulation techniques inherently non-scalable. We propose a new technique for the performance evaluation of large-scale caching systems that intelligently integrates elements of stochastic analysis within a MonteCarlo simulative approach, that we colloquially refer to as ModelGraft. Our approach (i) leverages the intuition that complex scenarios can be mapped to a simpler equivalent scenario that builds upon Time-To-Live (TTL) caches; it (ii) significantly downscales the scenario to lower computation and memory complexity, while, at the same time, preserving its properties to limit accuracy loss; finally, it (iii) is simple to use and robust, as it autonomously converges to a consistent state through a feedback-loop control system, regardless of the initial state. Performance evaluation shows that, with respect to classic event-driven simulation, ModelGraft gains over two orders of magnitude in both CPU time and memory complexity, while limiting accuracy loss below 2%. In addition, we show that ModelGraft extends performance evaluation well beyond the boundaries of classic approaches, by enabling study of Internet-scale scenarios with content catalogs comprising hundreds of billions objects.</p>

<p>Recently, a negative interplay has been shown to arise when scheduling/Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques and low-priority congestion control protocols are used together; namely, AQM resets the relative level of priority among congestion control protocols. This work explores this issue by carrying out a control-theoretic analysis of the dynamical system to prove some fundamental properties that fully characterize the reprioritization phenomenon. In particular, (i) we provide the closed-form solution of the equilibrium in the open loop (i.e., fixing a target loss probability p); (ii) we provide a stability analysis and a characterization of the reprioritization phenomenon when closing the loop with AQM (i.e., that dynamically adjusts the system loss probability). Our results are important as the characterization of the reprioritization phenomenon is not only quantitatively accurate for the specific protocols and AQM considered but also qualitatively accurate for a broader range of congestion control protocol and AQM combinations. Finally, while we find a sufficient condition to avoid the reprioritization phenomenon, we also show, at the same time, such conditions to be likely impractical: Therefore, we propose a simple and practical system-level solution that is able to reinstate priorities among protocols.</p>

<p>The analysis of Internet-scale Information-centric networks, and of cache networks in general, poses scalability issues like CPU and memory requirements, which can not be easily targeted by neither state-of-the-art analytical models nor well designed event-driven simulators. This demo focuses on showcasing performance of our new hybrid methodology, named ModelGraft, which we release as a simulation engine of the open-source ccnSim simulator: being able to seamlessly use a classic event-driven or the novel hybrid engine dramatically improves the flexibility and scalability of current simulative and analytical tools. In particular, ModelGraft combines elements and intuitions of stochastic analysis into a MonteCarlo simulative approach, offering a reduction of over two orders of magnitude in both CPU time and memory occupancy, with respect to the purely event-driven version of ccnSim, notably one of the most scalable simulators for Information-centric networks. This demo consists in gamifying the aforementioned comparison: we represent ModelGraft vs event-driven simulation as two athletes running a 100-meter competition using sprite-based animations. Differences between the two approaches in terms of CPU time, memory occupancy, and results accuracy, are highlighted in the score-board.</p>

<p>When considering to passively collect and then process network traffic traces, the need to analyze raw data at several Gbps and to extract higher level indexes from the stream of packets poses typical BigData-like challenges. In this paper, we engineer a methodology to extract, collect and process passive traffic traces. In particular, we design and implement analytics that, based on a filtering process and on the building of empirical distributions, enable the comparison between two generic collections, e.g., data gathered from two different vantage points, from different populations, or at different times. The ultimate goal is to highlight statistically significant differences that could be useful to flag to incidents for the network manager. After introducing the methodology, we apply it to assess the impact of Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN), a technology that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) deploy to limit the usage of expensive public IP addresses. Since CGN may introduce connectivity issues and performance degradation, we process a large dataset of passive measurements collected from an ISP using CGN for part of its customers. We first extract detailed per-flow information by processing packets from live links. Then, we derive higher level statistics that are significant for the end-users, e.g., TCP connection setup time, HTTP response time, or BitTorrent average download throughput. At last, we contrast figures of customers being offered public or private addresses, and look for statistically significant differences. Results show that CGN does not impair quality of service in the analyzed ISP deployment. In addition, we use the collected data to derive useful figures for the proper dimensioning of the CGN and the configuration of its parameters in order to avoid impairments on end-users experience</p>

<div id="NETWORKING-16" class="collapse">
<p>To cope with Internet video explosion, recent work proposes to deploy caches to absorb part of the traffic related to popular videos. Nonetheless, caching literature has mainly focused on network-centric metrics, while the quality of users’ video streaming experience should be the key performance index to optimize. Additionally, the general assumption is that each user request can be satisfied by a single object, which does not hold when multiple representations at different quality levels are available for the same video. Our contribution in this paper is to extend the classic object placement problem (which object to cache and where) by further considering the representation selection problem (i.e., which quality representation to cache), employing two methodologies to tackle this challenge. First, we employ a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to obtain the centralized optimal solution, as well as bounds to natural policies that are readily obtained as additional constraints of the MILP. Second, from the structure of the optimal solution, we learn guidelines that assist the design of distributed caching strategies: namely, we devise a simple yet effective distributed strategy that incrementally improves the quality of cached objects. Via simulation over large scale scenarios comprising up to hundred nodes and hundred million objects, we show our proposal to be effective in balancing user perceived utility vs bandwidth usage.	</p>

<div id="Abstract-NETWORKING-16" class="collapse well"> To cope with Internet video explosion, recent work proposes to deploy caches to absorb part of the traffic related to popular videos. Nonetheless, caching literature has mainly focused on network-centric metrics, while the quality of users’ video streaming experience should be the key performance index to optimize. Additionally, the general assumption is that each user request can be satisfied by a single object, which does not hold when multiple representations at different quality levels are available for the same video. Our contribution in this paper is to extend the classic object placement problem (which object to cache and where) by further considering the representation selection problem (i.e., which quality representation to cache), employing two methodologies to tackle this challenge. First, we employ a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to obtain the centralized optimal solution, as well as bounds to natural policies that are readily obtained as additional constraints of the MILP. Second, from the structure of the optimal solution, we learn guidelines that assist the design of distributed caching strategies: namely, we devise a simple yet effective distributed strategy that incrementally improves the quality of cached objects. Via simulation over large scale scenarios comprising up to hundred nodes and hundred million objects, we show our proposal to be effective in balancing user perceived utility vs bandwidth usage.	  </div>

<p>The BitMessage protocol offers privacy to its anonymous users.

Not only messages are sent to every node on the network (making it impossible to understand the intended recipient), but their content is encrypted with the intended recipient public key (so that s/he only can decipher it). As these two properties combined might facilitate spamming, a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism has been designed to mitigate this threat: only messages exhibiting properties of the PoW are forwarded on the network: since PoW is based on computationally heavy cryptographic functions, this slows down the rate at which spammers can introduce unsolicited messages in the network on the one hand, but also makes it harder to send legitimate messages for regular users on the other hand. In this paper, we (i) carry on an analysis of the current PoW mechanism, (ii) propose a very simple, yet very effective, generalization of the formula that decouples spammers vs legitimate users penalty showing that (iii) at the optimum, our proposal halves the harm spammers can do, avoiding by definition any impact for legitimate users.</p>

<p>In this paper, we present and validate an algorithm able to accurately identify anomalous behaviors on online and collaborative social networks, based on their interaction with other fellows. We focus on Wikipedia, where accurate ground truth for the classification of vandals can be reliably gathered by manual inspection of the page edit history. We develop a distributed crawler and classifier tasks, both implemented in MapReduce, with whom we are able to explore a very large dataset, consisting of over 5 millions articles collaboratively edited by 14 millions authors, resulting in over 8 billion pairwise interactions. We represent Wikipedia as a signed network, where positive arcs imply constructive interaction between editors. We then isolate a set of high reputation editors (i.e., nodes having many positive incoming links) and classify the remaining ones based on their interactions with high reputation editors. We demonstrate our approach not only to be practically relevant (due to the size of our dataset), but also feasible (as it requires few MapReduce iteration) and accurate (over 95% true positive rate). At the same time, we are able to classify only about half of the dataset editors (recall of 50%) for which we outline some solution under study.</p>

<p>Growing network complexity necessitates tools and methodologies to automate network troubleshooting. In this paper, we follow a crowd-sourcing trend, and argue for the need to deploy measurement probes at end-user devices and gateways, which can be under the control of the users or the ISP. Depending on the amount of information available to the probes (e.g., ISP topology), we formalize the network troubleshooting task as either a clustering or a classification problem, that we solve with an algorithm that (i) achieves perfect classification under the assumption of a strategic selection of probes (e.g., assisted by an ISP) and (ii) operates blindly with respect to the network performance metrics, of which we consider delay and bandwidth in this paper. While previous work on network troubleshooting privileges a more theoretical vs practical approaches, our workflow balances both aspects as (i) we conduct a set of controlled experiments with a rigorous and reproducible methodology, (ii) on an emulator that we thoroughly calibrate, (iii) contrasting experimental results affected by real-world noise with expected results from a probabilistic model.</p>

<p>Albeit an important goal of caching is traffic reduction, a perhaps even more important aspect follows from the above achievement: the reduction of Internet Service Provider (ISP) operational costs that comes as a consequence of the reduced load on transit and provider links. Surprisingly, to date this crucial aspect has not been properly taken into account in cache design. In this paper, we show that the classic caching efficiency indicator, i.e. the hit ratio, conflicts with cost. We therefore propose a mechanism whose goal is the reduction of cost and, in particular, we design a Cost-Aware (CoA) cache decision policy that, leveraging price heterogeneity among external links, tends to store with more probability the objects that the ISP has to retrieve through the most expensive links. We provide a model of our mechanism, based on Che’s approximation, and, by means of a thorough simulation campaign, we contrast it with traditional cost-blind schemes, showing that CoA yields a significant cost saving, that is furthermore consistent over a wide range of scenarios. We show that CoA is easy to implement and robust, making the proposal of practical relevance.</p>

<p>Caching is frequently used by Internet Service Providers as a viable technique to reduce the latency perceived by end users, while jointly offloading network traffic. While the cache hit-ratio is generally considered in the literature as the dominant performance metric for such type of systems, in this paper we argue that a critical missing piece has so far been neglected. Adopting a radically different perspective, in this paper we explicitly account for the cost of content retrieval, i.e. the cost associated to the external bandwidth needed by an ISP to retrieve the contents requested by its customers. Interestingly, we discover that classical cache provisioning techniques that maximize cache efficiency (i.e., the hit-ratio), lead to suboptimal solutions with higher overall cost. To show this mismatch, we propose two optimization models that either minimize the overall costs or maximize the hit-ratio, jointly providing cache sizing, object placement and path selection. We formulate a polynomial- time greedy algorithm to solve the two problems and analytically prove its optimality. We provide numerical results and show that significant cost savings are attainable via a cost-aware design.</p>

<p>A recent debate revolves around the usefulness of pervasive caching, i.e., adding caching capabilities to possibly every router of the future Internet. Recent research argues against it, on the ground that it provides only very limited gain with respect to the current CDN scenario, where caching only happens at the network edge. In this paper, we instead show that advantages of ubiquitous caching appear only when meta-caching (i.e., whether or not cache the incoming object) and forwarding (i.e., where to direct requests in case of cache miss) decisions are tightly coupled. Summarizing our contributions, we (i) show that gains can be obtained provided that ideal Nearest Replica Routing (iNRR) forwarding and Leave a Copy Down (LCD) meta-caching are jointly in use, (ii) model the iNRR forwarding policy, (iii) provide two alternative implementations that arbitrarily closely approximate iNRR behavior, and (iv) promote cross-comparison by making our code available to the community.</p>

Recent research argues against it, on the ground that it provides only very limited gain with respect to the current CDN scenario, where caching only happens at the network edge. In this paper, we instead show that advantages of ubiquitous caching appear only when meta-caching (i.e., whether or not cache the incoming object) and forwarding (i.e., where to direct requests in case of cache miss) decisions are tightly coupled. Summarizing our contributions, we (i) show that gains can be obtained provided that ideal Nearest Replica Routing (iNRR) forwarding and Leave a Copy Down (LCD) meta-caching are jointly in use, (ii) model the iNRR forwarding policy, (iii) provide two alternative implementations that arbitrarily closely approximate iNRR behavior, and (iv) promote cross-comparison by making our code available to the community.  </div>

<p>While numerous Information Centric Networking (ICN) architectures have been proposed over the last years, the community has so far only timidly attempted at a quantitative assessment of the relative quality of service level that users are expected to enjoy in each of them. This paper starts a journey toward the cross comparison of ICN alternatives, making several contributions along this road. Specifically, a census of 20 ICN software tools reveals that about 10 are dedicated to a specific architecture, about half of which are simulators. Second, we survey ICN research papers using simulation to gather information concerning the used simulator, finding that a large fraction either uses custom proprietary and unavailable software, or even plainly fails to mention any information on this regard, which is deceiving. Third, we cross-compare some of the available simulators, finding that they achieve consistent results, which is instead encouraging. Fourth, we propose a methodology to increase and promote cross- comparison, which is within reach but requires community-wide agreement, promotion and enforcement.</p>

<p>BitTorrent has recently introduced LEDBAT, a novel application-layer congestion control protocol for data exchange. The protocol design assumes that network bottlenecks are at the access of the network, and that thus user traffic competes creating self-induced congestion. To relieve this phenomenon, LEDBAT is designed to quickly infer when self-induced congestion is approaching (by detecting relative changes of the one-way delay in the transmission path), and to react promptly by reducing the sending rate prior to the congestion occurrence. Previous work has however shown LEDBAT to be affected by a latecomer advantage, where newly arriving connections can starve already existing flows. In this work, we propose modifications to the congestion window update mechanism of LEDBAT that solve this issue, thus guaranteeing intra-protocol fairness and efficiency. Closed-form expressions for the stationary throughput and queue occupancy are provided via a fluid model, whose accuracy is confirmed by means of ns2 packet level simulations. Our results show that the proposed change can effectively solve the latecomer issue, furthermore without affecting the other original LEDBAT goals.</p>

<p>The use of packet sampling for traffic measurement has become mandatory for network operators to cope with the huge amount of data transmitted in nowadays networks, powered by increasingly faster transmission technologies. Therefore, many networking tasks must already deal with such reduced data, more available but less rich in information. In this work we assess the impact of packet sampling on various network monitoring activities, with a particular focus on traffic characterization and classification. We process an extremely heterogeneous dataset composed of four packet level traces (representative of different access technologies and operational environments) with a traffic monitor able to apply different sampling policies and rates to the traffic and extract several features both in aggregated and per-flow fashion, providing empirical evidences of the impact of packet sampling on both traffic measurement and traffic classification. First, we analyze feature distortion, quantified by means of two statistical metrics: most features appear already deteriorated under low sampling step, no matter the sampling policy, while only a few remain consistent under harsh sampling conditions, which may even cause some artifacts undermining the correctness of measurements. Second, we evaluate the performance of traffic classification under sampling. The information content of features, even though deteriorated, still allows a good classification accuracy, provided that the classifier is trained with data obtained at the same sampling rate of the target data. The accuracy is also due to a thoughtful choice of a smart sampling policy which biases the sampling towards packets carrying the most useful information.</p>

<p>Content Centric Networking (CCN) is a promising architecture for the diffusion of popular content over the Internet. While CCN system design is sound, gathering a reliable estimate of its performance in the current Internet is challenging, due to the large scale and to the lack of agreement in some critical elements of the evaluation scenario. In this work, we add a number of important pieces to the CCN puzzle by means of a chunk-level simulator that we make available to the scientific community as open source software. First, we pay special attention to the locality of the user request process, as it may be determined by user interest or language barrier. Second, we consider the existence of possibly multiple repositories for the same content, as in the current Internet, along with different CCN interest forwarding policies, exploiting either a single or multiple repositories in parallel. To widen the relevance of our findings, we consider multi- ple topologies, content popularity settings, caching replacement policies and CCN forwarding strategies. Summarizing our main result, though the use of multiple content repositories can be beneficial from the user point of view, it may however counter part of the benefits if the CCN strategy layer implements naive interest forwarding policies.</p>

In this demo, we implement a methodology to monitor the upstream queuing delay experienced by remote hosts, both those using LEDBAT, through LEDBAT’s native one-way delay mea- surements, and those using TCP, through the timestamp option.

<p>BitTorrent, one of the most widespread used P2P application for file- sharing, recently got rid of TCP by introducing an application-level congestion control protocol named uTP. The aim of this new protocol is to efficiently use the available link capacity, while minimizing its interference with the rest of user traffic (e.g., Web, VoIP and gaming) sharing the same access bottleneck. In this paper we perform an experimental study of the impact of uTP on the torrent completion time, the metric that better captures the user experience. We run BitTorrent applications in a flash crowd scenario over a dedicated cluster platform, under both homogeneous and heterogeneous swarm population. Exper- iments show that an all-uTP swarms have shorter torrent download time with respect to all-TCP swarms. Interestingly, at the same time, we observe that even shorter completion times can be achieved under mixtures of TCP and uTP traffic, as in the default BitTorrent settings.</p>

<p>In this work, we study the caching performance of Content Centric Networking (CCN), with special emphasis on the size of individual CCN router caches. Specifically, we consider several graph-related centrality metrics (e.g., betweenness, closeness, stress, graph, eccentricity and degree centralities) to allocate content store space heterogeneously across the CCN network, and contrast the performance to that of an homogeneous allocation. To gather relevant results, we study CCN caching performance under large cache sizes (individual content stores of 10 GB), realistic topologies (up to 60 nodes), a YouTube-like Internet catalog (108 files for 1PB video data). A thorough simulation campaign allow us to conclude that (i) , the gain brought by content store size heterogeneity is very limited, and that (ii) the simplest metric, namely degree centrality, already proves to be a “sufficiently good” allocation criterion. On the one hand, this implies rather simple rules of thumb for the content store sizing (e.g., “if you add a line card to a CCN router, add some content store space as well”). On the other hand, we point out that technological constraints, such as line- speed operation requirement, may however limit the applicability of degree-based content store allocation.</p>

this bib is for my own publications.
basically redoing the format by hand.... looks nice though!

usage:
1) in _config.yml
	scholar:
  	[...]
  		bibliography_template: bib

2) however, from:	
	https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar#bibliography-template
	
	""You can also override the default bibliography template, by passing 
	the --template or -T option parameter to the bibliography tag.""

<p>This work addresses the performance evaluation of Content Centric Networks (CCN). Focusing on a realistic YouTube-like catalog, we conduct a thorough simulation study of the main system performance, with a special focus on multi-path interest forwarding strategies but thoroughly analyzing the impact of several other ingredients – such as network topology, content popularity, caching decisions and replacement policies. Summarizing our main results, (i) catalog and popularity settings play by far the most crucial role (ii) the impact of the strategy layer comes next, with naive forwarding strategies playing against CCN efficiency, (iii) simple randomized caching policies perform almost as well as more complex ones, (iv) the impact of the topology is limited. Hopefully, our thorough assessment of scenario parameters can assist and promote the cross-comparison in the research community – for which we also provide our CCN simulator as open source software.</p>
