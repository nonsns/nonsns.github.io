<p>Roughly speaking, anomaly detection consists of identifying instances whose features significantly deviate from the rest of input data. It is one of the most widely studied problems in unsupervised machine learning, boasting applications in network intrusion detection, fraud detection, healthcare and many others. Several methods have been developed in recent years, however, a satisfactory solution is still missing to the best of our knowledge. We present Random Histogram Forest an effective approach for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach is probabilistic, which has been proved to be effective in identifying anomalies. Moreover, it employs the fourth central moment (aka kurtosis), so as to identify potential anomalous instances. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on 38 datasets including all benchmarks for anomaly detection, as well as the most successful algorithms for unsupervised anomaly detection, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, we provide some novel datasets that are made publicly available. We evaluate all the approaches in terms of the average precision of the area under the precision-recall curve (AP) as well as ROC. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms all other approaches, both in terms of both AP and ROC, while boasting linear running time.</p>

<p>Recent technology evolution allows network equipment to continuously stream a wealth of “telemetry” information, which pertains to multiple protocols and layers of the stack, at a very fine spatial-grain and high-frequency. This deluge of telemetry data clearly offers new opportunities for network control and troubleshooting, but also poses a serious challenge for what concerns its real-time processing. We tackle this challenge by applying streaming machine-learning techniques to the continuous flow of control and data-plane telemetry data, with the purpose of real-time detection of anomalies. In particular, we implement an anomaly detection engine that leverages DenStream, an unsupervised clustering technique, and apply it to features collected from a large-scale testbed comprising tens of routers traversed up to 3 Terabit/s worth of real application traffic. We contrast DenStream with offline algorithms such as DBScan and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), as well as online algorithms such as the windowed version of DBScan, ExactSTORM, Continuous Outlier Detection (COD) and Robust Random Cut Forest (RRCF). Our experimental campaign compares these seven algorithms under both accuracy and computational complexity viewpoints: results testify that DenStream (i) achieves detection results on par with RRCF, the best performing algorithm and (ii) is significantly faster than other approaches, notably over two orders of magnitude faster than RRCF. In spirit with the recent trend toward reproducibility of results, we make our code available as open source to the scientific community.</p>

<p>This paper presents HURRA, a system that aims to reduce the time spent by human operators in the process of network troubleshooting. To do so, it comprises two modules that are plugged after any anomaly detection algorithm: (i) a first attention mechanism, that ranks the present features in terms of their relation with the anomaly and (ii) a second module able to incorporates previous expert knowledge seamlessly, without any need of human interaction nor decisions. We show the efficacy of these simple processes on a collection of real router datasets obtained from tens of ISPs which exhibit a rich variety of anomalies and very heterogeneous set of KPIs, on which we gather manually annotated ground truth by the operator solving the troubleshooting ticket. Our experimental evaluation shows that (i) the proposed system is effective in achieving high levels of agreement with the expert, that (ii) even a simple statistical approach is able to extracting useful information from expert knowledge gained in past cases to further improve performance and finally that (iii) the main difficulty in live deployment concerns the automated selection of the anomaly detection algorithm and the tuning of its hyper-parameters.</p>

<p>The increased interest towards Deep Learning (DL) tech-nologies has led to the development of a new generation of specialized hardware accelerator such as Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The integration of such components in network routers is however not trivial. Indeed, routers typically aim to minimize the overhead of per-packet processing, and design choices to integrate a new accelerator need to factor in these key requirements. The literature and benchmarks on DL hardware accelerators have overlooked specific router constraints (e.g., strict latency) and focused instead on cloud deployment and image processing. Likewise,there is limited literature regarding DL application on traffic processing at line-rate. Among all hardware accelerators, we are interested in edge TPUs. Since their design focuses on DL inference, edge TPUs matches the vision of operators, who consider running pre-trained DL models in routers with low power drain. Edge TPUs are expected to limit the amount of computational resources for inference and to yield a higher ratio of operations-per-watt footprint than GPUs.This demo aims to investigate the operational points at which edge TPUs become a viable option, using traffic classification as a use case. We sketch the design of a real-time DL traffic classification system, and compare inference speed (i.e., number of classifications per second) of a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model running on different hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU). To constrast their performance, we run stress tests based on synthetic traffic and under different conditions. We collect the results into a dashboard which enables network operators and system designers to both explore the stress test results with regards to their considered operational points, as well as triggering synthetic live tests on top of Ascend310 TPUs.</p>

<p>Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment for video games is known for being a heavy-weight process, typically requiring the active involvement of several human players and bringing limited transferability across games. Clearly, to some extent, QoE is correlated with the achieved in-game score, as player frustration will arise whenever realized performance is far from what is expected due to conditions beyond player control such as network congestion in the increasingly prevalent case of networked games. To disrupt the status quo, we propose to remove human players from the loop and instead exploit Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to play games under varying network conditions. We apply our framework to a set of Atari games with different types of interaction, showing that the score degradation observed with DRL agents can be exploited in networking devices (e.g., by prioritizing scheduling decisions), reinforcing fairness across games, and thus enhancing the overall quality of gaming experience</p>

<p>The Web is one of the most successful Internet applications. Yet, the quality of Web users’ experience is still largely impenetrable. Whereas Web performance is typically studied with controlled experiments, in this work we perform a large-scale study of a real site, Wikipedia, explicitly asking (a small fraction of its) users for feedback on the browsing experience. The analysis of the collected feedback reveals that 85% of users are satisfied, along with both expected (e.g., the impact of browser and network connectivity) and surprising findings (e.g., absence of day/night, weekday/weekend seasonality) that we detail in this paper. Also, we leverage user responses to build supervised data-driven models to predict user satisfaction which, despite including state-of-the art quality of experience metrics, are still far from achieving accurate results (0.62 recall of negative answers). Finally, we make our dataset publicly available, hopefully contributing in enriching and refining the scientific community knowledge on Web users’ QoE.</p>

<p>Web browsing is one of the most popular applications for both desktop and mobile users. A lot of effort has been devoted to speedup the Web, as well as in designing metrics that can accurately tell whether a webpage loaded fast or not. An often implicit assumption made by industrial and academic research communities is that a single metric is sufficient to assess whether a webpage loaded fast. In this paper we collect and make publicly available a unique dataset which contains webpage features (eg number and type of embedded objects) along with both objective and subjective Web quality metrics. This dataset was collected by crawling over 100 websites–representative of the top 1,000,000 websites in the Web — while crowdsourcing 6,000 user opinions on user perceived page load time (uPLT). We show that the uPLT distribution is often multi-modal and that, in practice, no more than three modes are present. The main conclusion drawn from our analysis is that, for complex webpages, each of the different objective QoE metrics proposed in the literature (such as AFT, TTI, PLT, etc.) is suited to approximate one of the different uPLT modes.</p>

<p>The ongoing network softwarization trend holds the promise to revolutionize network infrastructures by making them more flexible, reconfigurable, portable, and more adaptive than ever. Still, the migration from hard-coded/hard-wired network functions toward their software-programmable counterparts comes along with the need for tailored optimizations and acceleration techniques so as to avoid or at least mitigate the throughput/latency performance degradation with respect to fixed function network elements. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a comprehensive overview of the host-based network function virtualization (NFV) ecosystem, covering a broad range of techniques, from low-level hardware acceleration and bump-in-the-wire offloading approaches to high-level software acceleration solutions, including the virtualization technique itself. Second, we derive guidelines regarding the design, development, and operation of NFV-based deployments that meet the flexibility and scalability requirements of modern communication networks.</p>

<p>Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is among the latest network revolutions, bringing flexibility and avoiding network ossification. At the same time, all-software NFV implementations on commodity hardware raise performance issues with respect to ASIC solutions. To address these issues, numerous software acceleration frameworks for packet processing have appeared in the last few years. Common among these frameworks is the use of batching techniques. In this context, packets are processed in groups as opposed to individually, which is required at high-speed to minimize the framework overhead, reduce interrupt pressure, and leverage instruction-level cache hits. Whereas several system implementations have been proposed and experimentally benchmarked, the scientific community has so far only to a limited extent attempted to model the system dynamics of modern NFV routers exploiting batching acceleration. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a simple generic model for such batching-based mechanisms, which allows a very detailed prediction of highly relevant performance indicators. These include the distribution of the processed batch size as well as queue size, which can be used to identify loss-less operational regimes or quantify the packet loss probability in high-load scenarios. We contrast the model prediction with experimental results gathered in a high-speed testbed including an NFV router, showing that the model not only correctly captures system performance under simple conditions, but also in more realistic scenarios in which traffic is processed by a mixture of functions.</p>
