<div id="Abstract-SEC-21" class="collapse well"> Live traffic analysis at the first aggregation point in the ISP network enables the implementation of complex traffic engineering policies but is limited by the scarce processing capabilities, especially for Deep Learning (DL) based analytics. The introduction of specialized hardware accelerators i.e., Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), offers the opportunity to enhance processing capabilities of network devices at the edge. Yet, to date, no packet processing pipeline is capable of offering DL-based analysis capabilities in the data-plane, without interfering with network operations. In this paper, we present FENXI, a system to run complex analytics by leveraging TPU. The design of FENXI decouples forwarding operations and traffic analytics which operates at different granularities i.e., packet and flow levels. We conceive two independent modules that asynchronously communicate to exchange network data and analytics results, and design data structures to extract flow level statistics without impacting per-packet processing. We prototype FENXI on a general-purpose server and evaluate its performance in both adversarial and realistic network conditions. Our evaluation shows that FENXI is able to offer DL processing to 100 Gbps linecards with a limited number of resources, while also dynamically adapting to network conditions.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-INFOCOM-21" class="collapse well"> Today’s Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) rely on a centralized Access Controller (AC) entity for managing a fleet of Access Points (APs). Real-time analytics enable the AC to optimize the radio resource allocation (i.e. channels) on-line in response to sudden traffic shifts. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) relieves the pressure of finding good optimization heuristics by learning a policy through interactions with the environment. However, it is not granted that DRL will behave well in unseen conditions. Tools such as the WiFi Dynoscope introduced here are necessary to gain this trust. In a nutshell, this demo dissects the dynamics of WLAN networks, both simulated and from real large-scale deployments, by (i) comparatively analyzing the performance of different algorithms on the same deployment at high level and (ii) getting low-level details and insights into algorithmic behaviour.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-TECHREP-21-TC" class="collapse well"> The increasing success of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) has recently re-sparked interest towards traffic classification. While classification of known traffic is a well investigated subject with supervised classification tools (such as ML and DL models) are known to provide satisfactory performance, detection of unknown (or zero-day) traffic is more challenging and typically handled by unsupervised techniques (such as clustering algorithms). In this paper, we share our experience on a commercial-grade DL traffic classification engine that is able to (i) identify known applications from encrypted traffic, as well as (ii) handle unknown zero-day applications. In particular, our contribution for (i) is to perform a thorough assessment of state of the art traffic classifiers in commercial-grade settings comprising few thousands of very fine grained application labels, as opposite to the few tens of classes generally targeted in academic evaluations. Additionally, we contribute to the problem of (ii) detection of zero-day applications by proposing a novel technique, tailored for DL models, that is significantly more accurate and light-weight than the state of the art. Summarizing our main findings, we gather that (i) while ML and DL models are both equally able to provide satisfactory solution for classification of known traffic, however (ii) the non-linear feature extraction process of the DL backbone provides sizeable advantages for the detection of unknown classes.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-TECHREP-21-AIops" class="collapse well"> Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently attracted a lot of attention, transitioning from research labs to a wide range of successful deployments in many fields, which is particularly true for Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Ultimately, DL models are software artifacts, that, as any software realization, need to be regularly maintained and updated: consequently, as a logical extension of the DevOps software development practices to AI-software applied to network operation and management, AIOps foresee to continuously push evolved models in production networks. While for some network use-cases DL models can be incrementally updated at relatively low cost, the more typical case is that updating deployed DL models has a significant cost that needs to be managed. It follows that, during the lifecycle of DL model deployment, it is important to assess the relative “staleness” of deployed DL models, so to prioritize update of “ageing” models. In this article, we cover the issue of quality assessment and tracking of DL models deployed for network management purposes.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-TECHREP-21-DRL" class="collapse well"> Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques have recently gathered much attention for their ability to learn taking complex decisions in different fields: as such, they are an appealing candidate for network Operation and Management (O&amp;M). In particular, DRL can become a fundamental item in the toolbox of the so called “self-driving networks”, especially for tasks such as dynamic resource allocation, that is generally formulated and solved as complex optimization problems. Yet, training and deployment of DRL agents in real-world scenarios face important challenges, that we illustrate in this article using Wireless LANs as a relevant deployment example.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-TNSM-21a" class="collapse well"> Being on endpoints, Content Providers can easily evaluate end users’ web browsing quality of experience (web QoE) by accessing in-browser computed application-level metrics. Because of end-to-end traffic encryption, it is becoming considerably harder for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to evaluate the web QoE of their customers, which is important for management purposes. In this paper, we propose data-driven machine learning techniques and exact flow-level algorithmic methods to infer well-known application-level web performance metrics (such as SpeedIndex and Page Load Time) from raw encrypted streams of network traffic. We prove the efficiency of our approach taking as input a unique dataset of more than 200,000 experiments, targeting a large set of popular pages (Alexa top-500), from probes from several ISPs networks, with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox) and viewport combinations. Results show that our data-driven models are not only accurate for several web performance metrics, but also feature the ability to generalize to previously unseen conditions. Furthermore, we discuss how our extremely lightweight flow-level method has a provable accuracy on a specific metric, and is thus of particular appeal from a deployment viewpoint  </div>

<div id="Abstract-TECHREP-21-AD" class="collapse well"> Network troubleshooting is still a heavily human-intensive process. To reduce the time spent by human operators in the diagnosis process, we present a system based on (i) unsupervised learning methods for detecting anomalies in the time domain, (ii) an attention mechanism to rank features in the feature space and finally (iii) an expert knowledge module able to seamlessly incorporate previously collected domain-knowledge. In this paper, we thoroughly evaluate the performance of the full system and of its individual building blocks: particularly, we consider (i) 10 anomaly detection algorithms as well as (ii) 10 attention mechanisms, that comprehensively represent the current state of the art in the respective fields. Leveraging a unique collection of expert-labeled datasets worth several months of real router telemetry data, we perform a thorough performance evaluation contrasting practical results in constrained stream-mode settings, with the results achievable by an ideal oracle in academic settings. Our experimental evaluation shows that (i) the proposed system is effective in achieving high levels of agreement with the expert, and (ii) that even a simple statistical approach is able to extract useful information from expert knowledge gained in past cases, significantly improving troubleshooting performance.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-NETWORKING-21" class="collapse well"> Today’s WLANs rely on a centralized Access Controller (AC) entity for managing distributed wireless Access Points (APs) to which user devices connect. The availability of real-time analytics at the AC opens the possibility to automate the allocation of scarce radio resources, continuously adapting to changes in traffic demands. Often, the allocation problem is formulated in terms of weighted graph coloring, which is NP-hard, and custom heuristics are used to find satisfactory solutions. In this paper, we contrast solutions that are based on (and even improve) state of the art heuristics to a data-driven solution that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Based on both simulation results as well as experiments in a real deployment, we show that our DRL-based scheme not only learns to solve the complex combinatorial problem in bounded time, outperforming heuristics, but it also exhibits appealing generalization properties, e.g. to different network sizes and densities.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-ICDM-20" class="collapse well"> Roughly speaking, anomaly detection consists of identifying instances whose features significantly deviate from the rest of input data. It is one of the most widely studied problems in unsupervised machine learning, boasting applications in network intrusion detection, fraud detection, healthcare and many others. Several methods have been developed in recent years, however, a satisfactory solution is still missing to the best of our knowledge. We present Random Histogram Forest an effective approach for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach is probabilistic, which has been proved to be effective in identifying anomalies. Moreover, it employs the fourth central moment (aka kurtosis), so as to identify potential anomalous instances. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on 38 datasets including all benchmarks for anomaly detection, as well as the most successful algorithms for unsupervised anomaly detection, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, we provide some novel datasets that are made publicly available. We evaluate all the approaches in terms of the average precision of the area under the precision-recall curve (AP) as well as ROC. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms all other approaches, both in terms of both AP and ROC, while boasting linear running time.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-CNSM-20a" class="collapse well"> Web browsing is one of the key applications of the Internet, if not the most important one. We address the problem of Web Quality-of-Experience (QoE) monitoring from the ISP perspective, relying on in-network, passive measurements. As a proxy to Web QoE, we focus on the analysis of the well-known SpeedIndex (SI) metric. Given the lack of application-level-data visibility introduced by the wide adoption of end-to-end encryption, we resort to machine-learning models to infer the SI and the QoE level of individual web-page loading sessions, using as input only packet- and flow-level data. In this paper, we study the impact of different end-user device types (e.g., smartphone, desktop, tablet) on the performance of such models. Empirical evaluations on a large, multi-device, heterogeneous corpus of Web-QoE measurements for the most popular websites demonstrate that the proposed solution can infer the SI as well as estimate QoE ranges with high accuracy, using either packet-level or flow-level measurements. In addition, we show that the device type adds a strong bias to the feasibility of these Web-QoE models, putting into question the applicability of previously conceived approaches on single-device measurements. To improve the state of the art, we conceive cross-device generalizable models operating at both packet and flow levels, offering a feasible solution for Web-QoE monitoring in operational, multi-device networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study tackling the analysis of Web QoE from encrypted network traffic in multi-device scenarios.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-CNSM-20b" class="collapse well"> Quality of Experience (QoE) inference, and particularly the detection of its degradation is an important management tool for ISPs. Yet, this task is made difficult due to widespread use of encryption on the data-plane on the one hand so that measuring QoE is hard, and to the ephemeral properties of the web content on the other hand so that changes in QoE indicators may be rooted in changes in properties of the content itself, more than being caused by network-related events. In this paper, we phrase the QoE degradation detection issue as a change point detection problem, that we tackle by leveraging a unique dataset consisting on several hundreds thousands browsing sessions spanning multiple months. Our results, beyond showing feasibility, warn about the exclusive use of QoE indicators that are very close to content, as changes in the content space can lead to false alarms that are not tied to network-related problems.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-TNSM-20b" class="collapse well"> Recent technology evolution allows network equipment to continuously stream a wealth of “telemetry” information, which pertains to multiple protocols and layers of the stack, at a very fine spatial-grain and high-frequency. This deluge of telemetry data clearly offers new opportunities for network control and troubleshooting, but also poses a serious challenge for what concerns its real-time processing. We tackle this challenge by applying streaming machine-learning techniques to the continuous flow of control and data-plane telemetry data, with the purpose of real-time detection of anomalies. In particular, we implement an anomaly detection engine that leverages DenStream, an unsupervised clustering technique, and apply it to features collected from a large-scale testbed comprising tens of routers traversed up to 3 Terabit/s worth of real application traffic. We contrast DenStream with offline algorithms such as DBScan and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), as well as online algorithms such as the windowed version of DBScan, ExactSTORM, Continuous Outlier Detection (COD) and Robust Random Cut Forest (RRCF). Our experimental campaign compares these seven algorithms under both accuracy and computational complexity viewpoints: results testify that DenStream (i) achieves detection results on par with RRCF, the best performing algorithm and (ii) is significantly faster than other approaches, notably over two orders of magnitude faster than RRCF. In spirit with the recent trend toward reproducibility of results, we make our code available as open source to the scientific community.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-ITC-20" class="collapse well"> This paper presents HURRA, a system that aims to reduce the time spent by human operators in the process of network troubleshooting. To do so, it comprises two modules that are plugged after any anomaly detection algorithm: (i) a first attention mechanism, that ranks the present features in terms of their relation with the anomaly and (ii) a second module able to incorporates previous expert knowledge seamlessly, without any need of human interaction nor decisions. We show the efficacy of these simple processes on a collection of real router datasets obtained from tens of ISPs which exhibit a rich variety of anomalies and very heterogeneous set of KPIs, on which we gather manually annotated ground truth by the operator solving the troubleshooting ticket. Our experimental evaluation shows that (i) the proposed system is effective in achieving high levels of agreement with the expert, that (ii) even a simple statistical approach is able to extracting useful information from expert knowledge gained in past cases to further improve performance and finally that (iii) the main difficulty in live deployment concerns the automated selection of the anomaly detection algorithm and the tuning of its hyper-parameters.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-SIGCOMM-20" class="collapse well"> The increased interest towards Deep Learning (DL) tech-nologies has led to the development of a new generation of specialized hardware accelerator such as Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The integration of such components in network routers is however not trivial. Indeed, routers typically aim to minimize the overhead of per-packet processing, and design choices to integrate a new accelerator need to factor in these key requirements. The literature and benchmarks on DL hardware accelerators have overlooked specific router constraints (e.g., strict latency) and focused instead on cloud deployment and image processing. Likewise,there is limited literature regarding DL application on traffic processing at line-rate. Among all hardware accelerators, we are interested in edge TPUs. Since their design focuses on DL inference, edge TPUs matches the vision of operators, who consider running pre-trained DL models in routers with low power drain. Edge TPUs are expected to limit the amount of computational resources for inference and to yield a higher ratio of operations-per-watt footprint than GPUs.This demo aims to investigate the operational points at which edge TPUs become a viable option, using traffic classification as a use case. We sketch the design of a real-time DL traffic classification system, and compare inference speed (i.e., number of classifications per second) of a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model running on different hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU). To constrast their performance, we run stress tests based on synthetic traffic and under different conditions. We collect the results into a dashboard which enables network operators and system designers to both explore the stress test results with regards to their considered operational points, as well as triggering synthetic live tests on top of Ascend310 TPUs.  </div>

<div id="Abstract-INFOCOM-20a" class="collapse well"> Automated troubleshooting tools must be based on solid and principled algorithms to be useful. However, these tools need to be easily accessible for non-experts, thus requiring to also be usable. This demo combines both requirements by combining an anomaly detection engine inspired by Auto-ML principles, that combines multiple methods to find robust solutions, with automated ranking of results to provide an intuitive interface that is remindful of a search engine. The net result is that HURRA! simplifies as much as possible human operators interaction while providing them with the most useful results first. In the demo, we contrast manual labeling of individual features gathered from human operators from real troubleshooting tickets with results returned by the engine — showing an empirically good match at a fraction of the human labor.  </div>
