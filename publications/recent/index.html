This demo combines both requirements by combining an anomaly detection engine inspired by Auto-ML principles, that combines multiple methods to find robust solutions, with automated ranking of results to provide an intuitive interface that is remindful of a search engine. The net result is that HURRA! simplifies as much as possible human operators interaction while providing them with the most useful results first. In the demo, we contrast manual labeling of individual features gathered from human operators from real troubleshooting tickets with results returned by the engine — showing an empirically good match at a fraction of the human labor.</p>

<p>Fostered by the tremendous success in the image recognition field, recently there has been a strong push for the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in networks, especially at the edge, assisted by low-power hardware equipment (known as “tensor processing units”) for the acceleration of CNN- related computations. The availability of such hardware has reignited the interest for traffic classification approaches that are based on Deep Learning. However, unlike tree-based approaches that are easy to interpret, CNNs are in essence represented by a large number of weights, whose interpretation is particularly obscure for the human operators. Since human operators will need to deal, troubleshoot, and maintain these automatically learned models, that will replace the more easily human-readable heuristic rules of DPI classification engine, there is a clear need to open the “deep pandora box”, and make it easily accessible for network domain experts. In this demonstration, we shed light in the inference process of a commercial-grade classification engine dealing with hundreds of classes, enriching the classification workflow with tools to enable better understanding of the inner mechanics of both the traffic and the models.</p>

<p>Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment in video games is notorious for its burdensomeness. Employing human subjects to understand network impact on the perceived gaming QoE presents major drawbacks in terms of resources requirement, results interpretability and poor transferability across different games. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose to substitute human players with artificial agents trained with state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques. Equivalently to traditional QoE assessment, we measure the in-game score achieved by an artificial agent for the game of Doom for varying network parameters. Our results show that the proposed methodology can be applied to understand fine-grained impact of network conditions on gaming experience while opening a lot of new opportunities for network operators and game developers.</p>

<p>Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment for video games is known for being a heavy-weight process, typically requiring the active involvement of several human players and bringing limited transferability across games. Clearly, to some extent, QoE is correlated with the achieved in-game score, as player frustration will arise whenever realized performance is far from what is expected due to conditions beyond player control such as network congestion in the increasingly prevalent case of networked games. To disrupt the status quo, we propose to remove human players from the loop and instead exploit Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to play games under varying network conditions. We apply our framework to a set of Atari games with different types of interaction, showing that the score degradation observed with DRL agents can be exploited in networking devices (e.g., by prioritizing scheduling decisions), reinforcing fairness across games, and thus enhancing the overall quality of gaming experience</p>

<p>The Web is one of the most successful Internet applications. Yet, the quality of Web users’ experience is still largely impenetrable. Whereas Web performance is typically studied with controlled experiments, in this work we perform a large-scale study of a real site, Wikipedia, explicitly asking (a small fraction of its) users for feedback on the browsing experience. The analysis of the collected feedback reveals that 85% of users are satisfied, along with both expected (e.g., the impact of browser and network connectivity) and surprising findings (e.g., absence of day/night, weekday/weekend seasonality) that we detail in this paper. Also, we leverage user responses to build supervised data-driven models to predict user satisfaction which, despite including state-of-the art quality of experience metrics, are still far from achieving accurate results (0.62 recall of negative answers). Finally, we make our dataset publicly available, hopefully contributing in enriching and refining the scientific community knowledge on Web users’ QoE.</p>

<p>Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is among the latest network revolutions, bringing flexibility and avoiding network ossification. At the same time, all-software NFV implementations on commodity hardware raise performance issues with respect to ASIC solutions. To address these issues, numerous software acceleration frameworks for packet processing have appeared in the last few years. Common among these frameworks is the use of batching techniques. In this context, packets are processed in groups as opposed to individually, which is required at high-speed to minimize the framework overhead, reduce interrupt pressure, and leverage instruction-level cache hits. Whereas several system implementations have been proposed and experimentally benchmarked, the scientific community has so far only to a limited extent attempted to model the system dynamics of modern NFV routers exploiting batching acceleration. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a simple generic model for such batching-based mechanisms, which allows a very detailed prediction of highly relevant performance indicators. These include the distribution of the processed batch size as well as queue size, which can be used to identify loss-less operational regimes or quantify the packet loss probability in high-load scenarios.

<p>In the last few years, several software-based solutions have been proved to be very efficient for high-speed packet processing, traffic generation and monitoring, and can be considered valid alternatives to expensive and non-flexible hardware-based solutions. In our work, we first benchmark heterogeneous design choices for software-based packet monitoring systems in terms of achievable performance and required resources (i.e., the number of CPU cores). Building on this extensive analysis we design FloWatcher-DPDK, a DPDK-based high-speed software traffic monitor we provide to the community as an open source project. In a nutshell, FloWatcher-DPDK provides tunable fine-grained statistics at packet and flow levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FloWatcher-DPDK sustains per-flow statistics with 5-nines precision at high-speed (e.g., 14.88 Mpps) using a limited amount of resources. Finally, we showcase the usage of FloWatcher-DPDK by configuring it to analyze the performance of two open source prototypes for stateful flow-level end-host and in-network packet processing.</p>

<p>Packet classification is an important part of many networking devices, such as routers and firewalls. Software Defined Networking (SDN) heavily relies on online packet classification which must efficiently process two different streams: incoming packets to classify and rules to update. This rules out many offline packet classification algorithms that do not support fast updates. We propose a novel online classification algorithm, TupleMerge (TM), derived from Tuple Space Search (TSS), the packet classifier used by Open vSwitch (OVS). TM improves upon TSS by combining hash tables which contain rules with similar characteristics. This greatly reduces classification time preserving similar performance in updates. We validate the effectiveness of TM using both simulation and deployment in an full-fledged software router, specifically within Vector Packet Processor (VPP). In our simulation results, which focus solely on the efficiency of the classification algorithm, we demonstrate that TM outperforms all other state of the art methods including TSS, PartitionSort (PS), and SAX-PAC. For example, TM is 34% faster at classifying packets and 30% faster at updating rules than PS. We then evaluate experimentally TM deployed within the VPP framework comparing TM against linear search and TSS, and also against TSS within the OVS framework. This validation of deployed implementations is important as SDN frameworks have several optimizations such as caches that may minimize the influence of a classification algorithm. Our experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of TM. VPP TM classifies packets nearly two orders of magnitude faster than VPP TSS and at least one order of magnitude faster than OVS TSS.</p>

In this demo, we showcase that such metrics can be estimated quite accurately just from streams of encrypted packets, using classic supervised learning techniques.  </div>

<p>Recent research has identified Information-Centric Networking (ICN) as a good fit for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. However, most studies have focused on ICN as an application enabler, disregarding the behaviour from a network viewpoint. In this paper, we address this by studying the most important properties of an ICN-IoT deployment and contrast the operational costs between geographic-based forwarding and name-based forwarding schemes. We aim to understand if, and under which IoT deployment characteristics, geographic forwarding constitutes an advantage over name-based schemes, in terms of feasibility (i.e., memory footprint and computational capability of the devices) and performance (which we analyze as the overall energy cost of operating an ICN-IoT network under either forwarding paradigm). To achieve this goal, we employ a mixture of (i) modelling, (ii) simulative and (iii) experimental methodologies, which are useful to respectively (i) state the problem in a principled way, (ii) gather information about topological properties that are instrumental to the model and (iii) gather physical properties of the devices to feed the model with realistic data. In a nutshell, our results show that geographic forwarding (i) halves the memory footprint on our reference deployments and (ii) yields significant energy savings, especially for dynamic topologies.</p>

<p>In the last decade, a number of frameworks started to appear that implement, directly in user-space with kernel-bypass mode, high-speed software data plane functionalities on commodity hardware. Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is one of such frameworks, representing an interesting point in the design space in that it offers: (i) in user-space networking, (ii) the flexibility of a modular router (Click and variants) with (iii) the benefits brought by techniques such as batch processing that have become commonplace in high-speed networking stacks (such as netmap or DPDK). Similarly to Click, VPP lets users arrange functions as a processing graph, providing a full-blown stack of network functions. However, unlike Click where the whole tree is traversed for each packet, in VPP each traversed node processes all packets in the batch (called \textitvector) before moving to the next node. This design choice enables several code optimizations that greatly improve the achievable processing throughput.

<p>Recent research has put forward the concept of Fog computing, a deported intelligence for IoT networks. Fog clusters are meant to complement current cloud deployments, providing compute and storage resources directly in the access network – which is particularly useful for low-latency applications. How- ever, Fog deployments are expected to be less elastic than cloud platforms, since elasticity in Cloud platforms comes from the scale of the data-centers. Thus, a Fog node dimensioned for the average traffic load of a given application will not be able to handle sudden bursts of traffic. In this paper, we explore such a use-case, where a Fog-based latency-sensitive application must offload some of its processing to the Cloud. We build an analytical queueing model for deriving the statistical response time of a Fog deployment under different request Load Balancing (LB) strategies, contrasting a naive, an ideal (LFU-LB, assuming a priori knowledge of the request popularity) and a practical (LRU-LB, based on online learning of the popularity with an LRU filter) scheme. Using our model, and confirming the results through simulation, we show that our LRU-LB proposal achieves close-to-ideal performance, with high savings on Cloud offload cost with respect to a request-oblivious strategy in the explored scenarios.</p>

<p>In this paper we propose a methodology for the study of general cache networks, which is intrinsically scalable and amenable to parallel execution. We contrast two techniques: one that slices the network, and another that slices the content catalog. In the former, each core simulates requests for the whole catalog on a subgraph of the original topology, whereas in the latter each core simulates requests for a portion of the original catalog on a replica of the whole network. Interestingly, we find out that when the number of cores increases (and so the split ratio of the network topology), the overhead of message passing required to keeping consistency among nodes actually offsets any benefit from the parallelization: this is strictly due to the correlation among neighboring caches, meaning that requests arriving at one cache allocated on one core may depend on the status of one or more caches allocated on different cores. Even more interestingly, we find out that the newly proposed catalog slicing, on the contrary, achieves an ideal speedup in the number of cores. Overall, our system, which we make available as open source software, enables performance assessment of large-scale general cache networks, i.e., comprising hundreds of nodes, trillions contents, and complex routing and caching algorithms, in minutes of CPU time and with exiguous amounts of memory.</p>

	-basically one each day; just dicovered that any garbage here
	(comments, white spaces, etc.) gets rendered in the final HTML	
v1 // Wed Jan 31 01:31:03 CET 2018

this bib is for my own publications.
basically redoing the format by hand.... looks nice though!

usage:
1) in _config.yml
	scholar:
  	[...]
  		bibliography_template: bib

2) however, from:	
	https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar#bibliography-template
	
	""You can also override the default bibliography template, by passing 
	the --template or -T option parameter to the bibliography tag.""

<p>Page load time (PLT) is still the most common application Quality of Service (QoS) metric to estimate the Quality of Experience (QoE) of Web users. Yet, recent literature abounds with interesting proposals for alternative metrics (e.g., Above The Fold, SpeedIndex and variants) that aim at closely capturing how users perceive the Webpage rendering process. However, these novel metrics are typically computationally expensive, as they require to monitor and post-process videos of the rendering process, and have failed to be widely deployed. In this demo, we show our implementation of an open-source Chrome extension that implements a practical and lightweight method to measure the approximated Above-the-Fold (AATF) time, as well as others Web performance metrics. The idea is, instead of accurately monitoring the rendering output, to track the download time of the last visible object on screen (i.e., “above the fold”). Our plugin also has options to save detailed reports for later analysis, a functionality ideally suited for researchers wanting to gather data from Web experiments.</p>
