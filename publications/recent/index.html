<p>The Web is one of the most successful Internet application. Yet, the quality of Web users’ experience is still largely impenetrable. Whereas Web performances are typically gathered with controlled experiments, in this work we perform a large-scale study of one of the most popular Web sites, namely Wikipedia, explicitly asking (a small fraction of its) users for feedback on the browsing experience. We leverage user survey responses to build a data-driven model of user satisfaction which, despite including state-of-the art quality of experience metrics, is still far from achieving accurate results, and discuss directions to move forward. Finally, we aim at making our dataset publicly available, which hopefully contributes in enriching and refining the scientific community knowledge on Web users’ quality of experience (QoE).</p>

<p>The ongoing network softwarization trend holds the promise to revolutionize network infrastructures by making them more flexible, reconfigurable, portable, and more adaptive than ever. Still, the migration from hard-coded/hard-wired network functions toward their software-programmable counterparts comes along with the need for tailored optimizations and acceleration techniques so as to avoid or at least mitigate the throughput/latency performance degradation with respect to fixed function network elements. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a comprehensive overview of the host-based network function virtualization (NFV) ecosystem, covering a broad range of techniques, from low-level hardware acceleration and bump-in-the-wire offloading approaches to high-level software acceleration solutions, including the virtualization technique itself. Second, we derive guidelines regarding the design, development, and operation of NFV-based deployments that meet the flexibility and scalability requirements of modern communication networks.</p>

<p>Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is among the latest network revolutions, bringing flexibility and avoiding network ossification. At the same time, all-software NFV implementations on commodity hardware raise performance issues with respect to ASIC solutions. To address these issues, numerous software acceleration frameworks for packet processing have appeared in the last few years. Common among these frameworks is the use of batching techniques. In this context, packets are processed in groups as opposed to individually, which is required at high-speed to minimize the framework overhead, reduce interrupt pressure, and leverage instruction-level cache hits. Whereas several system implementations have been proposed and experimentally benchmarked, the scientific community has so far only to a limited extent attempted to model the system dynamics of modern NFV routers exploiting batching acceleration. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a simple generic model for such batching-based mechanisms, which allows a very detailed prediction of highly relevant performance indicators. These include the distribution of the processed batch size as well as queue size, which can be used to identify loss-less operational regimes or quantify the packet loss probability in high-load scenarios. We contrast the model prediction with experimental results gathered in a high-speed testbed including an NFV router, showing that the model not only correctly captures system performance under simple conditions, but also in more realistic scenarios in which traffic is processed by a mixture of functions.</p>

<p>Recent research has identified Information-Centric Networking (ICN) as a good fit for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. However, most studies have focused on ICN as an application enabler, disregarding the behaviour from a network viewpoint. In this paper, we address this by studying the most important properties of an ICN-IoT deployment and contrast the operational costs between geographic-based forwarding and name-based forwarding schemes. We aim to understand if, and under which IoT deployment characteristics, geographic forwarding constitutes an advantage over name-based schemes, in terms of feasibility (i.e., memory footprint and computational capability of the devices) and performance (which we analyze as the overall energy cost of operating an ICN-IoT network under either forwarding paradigm). To achieve this goal, we employ a mixture of (i) modelling, (ii) simulative and (iii) experimental methodologies, which are useful to respectively (i) state the problem in a principled way, (ii) gather information about topological properties that are instrumental to the model and (iii) gather physical properties of the devices to feed the model with realistic data. In a nutshell, our results show that geographic forwarding (i) halves the memory footprint on our reference deployments and (ii) yields significant energy savings, especially for dynamic topologies.</p>

<p>Recent research has put forward the concept of Fog computing, a deported intelligence for IoT networks. Fog clusters are meant to complement current cloud deployments, providing compute and storage resources directly in the access network – which is particularly useful for low-latency applications. How- ever, Fog deployments are expected to be less elastic than cloud platforms, since elasticity in Cloud platforms comes from the scale of the data-centers. Thus, a Fog node dimensioned for the average traffic load of a given application will not be able to handle sudden bursts of traffic. In this paper, we explore such a use-case, where a Fog-based latency-sensitive application must offload some of its processing to the Cloud. We build an analytical queueing model for deriving the statistical response time of a Fog deployment under different request Load Balancing (LB) strategies, contrasting a naive, an ideal (LFU-LB, assuming a priori knowledge of the request popularity) and a practical (LRU-LB, based on online learning of the popularity with an LRU filter) scheme. Using our model, and confirming the results through simulation, we show that our LRU-LB proposal achieves close-to-ideal performance, with high savings on Cloud offload cost with respect to a request-oblivious strategy in the explored scenarios.</p>

<p>Recent technology evolution allows network equipments to continuously stream a wealth of "telemetry" information, which pertains to multiple protocols and layers of the tack, at a very fine spatial-grain and high-frequency. Processing this deluge of telemetry data in real-time clearly offers new opportunities for network control and troubleshooting, but also poses serious challenges. We tackle this challenge by applying streaming machine-learning techniques to the continuous flow of control and data-plane telemetry data, with the purpose of real-time detection of BGP anomalies. In particular, we implement an anomaly detection engine that leverages DenStream, an unsupervised clustering technique, and apply it to features collected from a large-scale testbed comprising tens of routers traversed by 1 Terabit/s worth of real application traffic. In spirit with the recent trend toward reproducibility of research results, we make our code and datasets available as open source to the scientific community</p>

<p>Page load time (PLT) is still the most common application Quality of Service (QoS) metric to estimate the Quality of Experience (QoE) of Web users.

However, these novel metrics are typically computationally expensive, as they require to monitor and post-process videos of the rendering process, and have failed to be widely deployed. In this demo, we show our implementation of an open-source Chrome extension that implements a practical and lightweight method to measure the approximated Above-the-Fold (AATF) time, as well as others Web performance metrics. The idea is, instead of accurately monitoring the rendering output, to track the download time of the last visible object on screen (i.e., “above the fold”).

<p>Software packet processing is an intriguing approach due to its tremendous flexibility and cost reduction compared with hardware solutions, which have long dominated software performance. However, the emergence of fast packet I/O frameworks challenges hardware supremacy, as software solutions based on commodity hardware manage to process packets at high speed (10-40 Gbps). Whereas novel packet processing applications based on these new frameworks proliferate, fine-grained traffic monitor at high speed has received comparatively less attention. In this demonstration, we showcase FlowMon-DPDK a novel software traffic monitor recently published at TMA 2018, based on the Intel DPDK I/O framework. Our monitor is capable of providing runtime statistics at both packet- and flow-levels at 10 Gbit/s using a minimal amount of CPU resources, with packet losses that are order of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art software. A video showing the demonstration is available at \urlhttps://youtu.be/B8uaw9UgMm0. For further details, please refer to our TMA 2018 paper.</p>

<p>In 2012, Google introduced the Speed Index (SI) metric to quantify the speed of the Web page visual completeness for the actually displayed above-the-fold (ATF) portion of a Web page. In Web browsing a page might appear to the user to be already fully rendered, even though further content may still be retrieved, resulting in the Page Load Time (PLT). This happens due to the browser progressively rendering all objects, part of which can also be located below the browser window’s current viewport. The SI metric (and variants) thereof have since established themselves as a de facto standard in Web page and browser testing. While SI is a step in the direction of including the user experience into Web metrics, the actual meaning of the metric and especially its relationship between Speed Index and Web QoE is however far from being clear. The contributions of this paper are thus to first develop an understanding of the SI based on a theoretical analysis and second, to analyze the interdependency between SI and MOS values from an existing public dataset.

<p>Testing experimental network devices requires deep performance analysis, which is usually performed with expensive, not flexible, hardware equipment. With the advent of high- speed packet I/O frameworks, general purpose equipments have narrowed the performance gap in respect of dedicated hardware and a variety of software-based solutions have emerged for handling traffic at very high speed. While the literature abounds with software traffic generators, existing monitoring solutions do not target worst-case scenarios (i.e., 64B packets at line rate) that are particularly relevant for stress-testing high-speed network functions, or occupy too many resources. In this paper we first analyze the design space for high-speed traffic monitoring that leads us to specific choices characterizing FlowMon-DPDK, a DPDK-based software traffic monitor that we make available as open source software. In a nutshell, FlowMon-DPDK provides tunable fine-grained statistics at both packet and flow levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our traffic monitor is able to provide per-flow statistics with 5-nines precision at high-speed (14.88 Mpps) using a exiguous amount of resources.

<p>In the last decade, a number of frameworks started to appear that implement, directly in user-space with kernel-bypass mode, high-speed software data plane functionalities on commodity hardware. Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is one of such frameworks, representing an interesting point in the design space in that it offers: (i) in user-space networking, (ii) the flexibility of a modular router (Click and variants) with (iii) the benefits brought by techniques such as batch processing that have become commonplace in lower-level building blocks of high-speed networking stacks (such as netmap or DPDK). Similarly to Click, VPP lets users arrange functions as a processing graph, providing a full-blown stack of network functions. However, unlike Click where the whole tree is traversed for each packet, in VPP each traversed node processes all packets in the batch before moving to the next node. This design choice enables several code optimizations that greatly improve the achievable processing throughput: the purpose of this demonstration is to introduce the main VPP concepts and architecture, as well as experimentally showing the impact of design choices –and especially of batch packet processing–, on the achievable packet forwarding performance.</p>

Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is one of such frameworks, representing an interesting point in the design space in that it offers: (i) in user-space networking, (ii) the flexibility of a modular router (Click and variants) with (iii) the benefits brought by techniques such as batch processing that have become commonplace in lower-level building blocks of high-speed networking stacks (such as netmap or DPDK). Similarly to Click, VPP lets users arrange functions as a processing graph, providing a full-blown stack of network functions. However, unlike Click where the whole tree is traversed for each packet, in VPP each traversed node processes all packets in the batch before moving to the next node. This design choice enables several code optimizations that greatly improve the achievable processing throughput: the purpose of this demonstration is to introduce the main VPP concepts and architecture, as well as experimentally showing the impact of design choices –and especially of batch packet processing–, on the achievable packet forwarding performance.  </div>
