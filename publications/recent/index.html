<p>Roughly speaking, anomaly detection consists of identifying instances whose features significantly deviate from the rest of input data. It is one of the most widely studied problems in unsupervised machine learning, boasting applications in network intrusion detection, fraud detection, healthcare and many others. Several methods have been developed in recent years, however, a satisfactory solution is still missing to the best of our knowledge. We present Random Histogram Forest an effective approach for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach is probabilistic, which has been proved to be effective in identifying anomalies. Moreover, it employs the fourth central moment (aka kurtosis), so as to identify potential anomalous instances. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on 38 datasets including all benchmarks for anomaly detection, as well as the most successful algorithms for unsupervised anomaly detection, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, we provide some novel datasets that are made publicly available. We evaluate all the approaches in terms of the average precision of the area under the precision-recall curve (AP) as well as ROC. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms all other approaches, both in terms of both AP and ROC, while boasting linear running time.</p>

<p>This paper presents HURRA, a system that aims to reduce the time spent by human operators in the process of network troubleshooting. To do so, it comprises two modules that are plugged after any anomaly detection algorithm: (i) a first attention mechanism, that ranks the present features in terms of their relation with the anomaly and (ii) a second module able to incorporates previous expert knowledge seamlessly, without any need of human interaction nor decisions. We show the efficacy of these simple processes on a collection of real router datasets obtained from tens of ISPs which exhibit a rich variety of anomalies and very heterogeneous set of KPIs, on which we gather manually annotated ground truth by the operator solving the troubleshooting ticket. Our experimental evaluation shows that (i) the proposed system is effective in achieving high levels of agreement with the expert, that (ii) even a simple statistical approach is able to extracting useful information from expert knowledge gained in past cases to further improve performance and finally that (iii) the main difficulty in live deployment concerns the automated selection of the anomaly detection algorithm and the tuning of its hyper-parameters.</p>

<div id="SIGCOMM-20" class="collapse">
<p>The increased interest towards Deep Learning (DL) tech-nologies has led to the development of a new generation of specialized hardware accelerator such as Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The integration of such components in network routers is however not trivial. Indeed, routers typically aim to minimize the overhead of per-packet processing, and design choices to integrate a new accelerator need to factor in these key requirements. The literature and benchmarks on DL hardware accelerators have overlooked specific router constraints (e.g., strict latency) and focused instead on cloud deployment and image processing. Likewise,there is limited literature regarding DL application on traffic processing at line-rate. Among all hardware accelerators, we are interested in edge TPUs. Since their design focuses on DL inference, edge TPUs matches the vision of operators, who consider running pre-trained DL models in routers with low power drain. Edge TPUs are expected to limit the amount of computational resources for inference and to yield a higher ratio of operations-per-watt footprint than GPUs.This demo aims to investigate the operational points at which edge TPUs become a viable option, using traffic classification as a use case. We sketch the design of a real-time DL traffic classification system, and compare inference speed (i.e., number of classifications per second) of a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model running on different hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU). To constrast their performance, we run stress tests based on synthetic traffic and under different conditions. We collect the results into a dashboard which enables network operators and system designers to both explore the stress test results with regards to their considered operational points, as well as triggering synthetic live tests on top of Ascend310 TPUs.</p>

<div id="Abstract-SIGCOMM-20" class="collapse well"> The increased interest towards Deep Learning (DL) tech-nologies has led to the development of a new generation of specialized hardware accelerator such as Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The integration of such components in network routers is however not trivial. Indeed, routers typically aim to minimize the overhead of per-packet processing, and design choices to integrate a new accelerator need to factor in these key requirements. The literature and benchmarks on DL hardware accelerators have overlooked specific router constraints (e.g., strict latency) and focused instead on cloud deployment and image processing. Likewise,there is limited literature regarding DL application on traffic processing at line-rate. Among all hardware accelerators, we are interested in edge TPUs. Since their design focuses on DL inference, edge TPUs matches the vision of operators, who consider running pre-trained DL models in routers with low power drain. Edge TPUs are expected to limit the amount of computational resources for inference and to yield a higher ratio of operations-per-watt footprint than GPUs.This demo aims to investigate the operational points at which edge TPUs become a viable option, using traffic classification as a use case. We sketch the design of a real-time DL traffic classification system, and compare inference speed (i.e., number of classifications per second) of a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model running on different hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU). To constrast their performance, we run stress tests based on synthetic traffic and under different conditions. We collect the results into a dashboard which enables network operators and system designers to both explore the stress test results with regards to their considered operational points, as well as triggering synthetic live tests on top of Ascend310 TPUs.  </div>

<p>Web browsing is one of the most popular applications for both desktop and mobile users. A lot of effort has been devoted to speedup the Web, as well as in designing metrics that can accurately tell whether a webpage loaded fast or not. An often implicit assumption made by industrial and academic research communities is that a single metric is sufficient to assess whether a webpage loaded fast. In this paper we collect and make publicly available a unique dataset which contains webpage features (eg number and type of embedded objects) along with both objective and subjective Web quality metrics. This dataset was collected by crawling over 100 websites–representative of the top 1,000,000 websites in the Web — while crowdsourcing 6,000 user opinions on user perceived page load time (uPLT). We show that the uPLT distribution is often multi-modal and that, in practice, no more than three modes are present. The main conclusion drawn from our analysis is that, for complex webpages, each of the different objective QoE metrics proposed in the literature (such as AFT, TTI, PLT, etc.) is suited to approximate one of the different uPLT modes.</p>

<p>The ongoing network softwarization trend holds the promise to revolutionize network infrastructures by making them more flexible, reconfigurable, portable, and more adaptive than ever.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a comprehensive overview of the host-based network function virtualization (NFV) ecosystem, covering a broad range of techniques, from low-level hardware acceleration and bump-in-the-wire offloading approaches to high-level software acceleration solutions, including the virtualization technique itself.

<p>Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is among the latest network revolutions, bringing flexibility and avoiding network ossification. At the same time, all-software NFV implementations on commodity hardware raise performance issues with respect to ASIC solutions. To address these issues, numerous software acceleration frameworks for packet processing have appeared in the last few years. Common among these frameworks is the use of batching techniques. In this context, packets are processed in groups as opposed to individually, which is required at high-speed to minimize the framework overhead, reduce interrupt pressure, and leverage instruction-level cache hits. Whereas several system implementations have been proposed and experimentally benchmarked, the scientific community has so far only to a limited extent attempted to model the system dynamics of modern NFV routers exploiting batching acceleration. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a simple generic model for such batching-based mechanisms, which allows a very detailed prediction of highly relevant performance indicators. These include the distribution of the processed batch size as well as queue size, which can be used to identify loss-less operational regimes or quantify the packet loss probability in high-load scenarios. We contrast the model prediction with experimental results gathered in a high-speed testbed including an NFV router, showing that the model not only correctly captures system performance under simple conditions, but also in more realistic scenarios in which traffic is processed by a mixture of functions.</p>

In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a simple generic model for such batching-based mechanisms, which allows a very detailed prediction of highly relevant performance indicators. These include the distribution of the processed batch size as well as queue size, which can be used to identify loss-less operational regimes or quantify the packet loss probability in high-load scenarios. We contrast the model prediction with experimental results gathered in a high-speed testbed including an NFV router, showing that the model not only correctly captures system performance under simple conditions, but also in more realistic scenarios in which traffic is processed by a mixture of functions.  </div>

<p>In the last few years, several software-based solutions have been proved to be very efficient for high-speed packet processing, traffic generation and monitoring, and can be considered valid alternatives to expensive and non-flexible hardware-based solutions. In our work, we first benchmark heterogeneous design choices for software-based packet monitoring systems in terms of achievable performance and required resources (i.e., the number of CPU cores). Building on this extensive analysis we design FloWatcher-DPDK, a DPDK-based high-speed software traffic monitor we provide to the community as an open source project. In a nutshell, FloWatcher-DPDK provides tunable fine-grained statistics at packet and flow levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FloWatcher-DPDK sustains per-flow statistics with 5-nines precision at high-speed (e.g., 14.88 Mpps) using a limited amount of resources. Finally, we showcase the usage of FloWatcher-DPDK by configuring it to analyze the performance of two open source prototypes for stateful flow-level end-host and in-network packet processing.</p>

<p>Packet classification is an important part of many networking devices, such as routers and firewalls. Software Defined Networking (SDN) heavily relies on online packet classification which must efficiently process two different streams: incoming packets to classify and rules to update. This rules out many offline packet classification algorithms that do not support fast updates. We propose a novel online classification algorithm, TupleMerge (TM), derived from Tuple Space Search (TSS), the packet classifier used by Open vSwitch (OVS). TM improves upon TSS by combining hash tables which contain rules with similar characteristics. This greatly reduces classification time preserving similar performance in updates. We validate the effectiveness of TM using both simulation and deployment in an full-fledged software router, specifically within Vector Packet Processor (VPP). In our simulation results, which focus solely on the efficiency of the classification algorithm, we demonstrate that TM outperforms all other state of the art methods including TSS, PartitionSort (PS), and SAX-PAC. For example, TM is 34% faster at classifying packets and 30% faster at updating rules than PS. We then evaluate experimentally TM deployed within the VPP framework comparing TM against linear search and TSS, and also against TSS within the OVS framework. This validation of deployed implementations is important as SDN frameworks have several optimizations such as caches that may minimize the influence of a classification algorithm. Our experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of TM. VPP TM classifies packets nearly two orders of magnitude faster than VPP TSS and at least one order of magnitude faster than OVS TSS.</p>

<p>Recent research has identified Information-Centric Networking (ICN) as a good fit for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. However, most studies have focused on ICN as an application enabler, disregarding the behaviour from a network viewpoint. In this paper, we address this by studying the most important properties of an ICN-IoT deployment and contrast the operational costs between geographic-based forwarding and name-based forwarding schemes. We aim to understand if, and under which IoT deployment characteristics, geographic forwarding constitutes an advantage over name-based schemes, in terms of feasibility (i.e., memory footprint and computational capability of the devices) and performance (which we analyze as the overall energy cost of operating an ICN-IoT network under either forwarding paradigm). To achieve this goal, we employ a mixture of (i) modelling, (ii) simulative and (iii) experimental methodologies, which are useful to respectively (i) state the problem in a principled way, (ii) gather information about topological properties that are instrumental to the model and (iii) gather physical properties of the devices to feed the model with realistic data. In a nutshell, our results show that geographic forwarding (i) halves the memory footprint on our reference deployments and (ii) yields significant energy savings, especially for dynamic topologies.</p>

	-basically one each day; just dicovered that any garbage here
	(comments, white spaces, etc.) gets rendered in the final HTML	
v1 // Wed Jan 31 01:31:03 CET 2018

this bib is for my own publications.
basically redoing the format by hand.... looks nice though!

usage:
1) in _config.yml
	scholar:
  	[...]
  		bibliography_template: bib

2) however, from:	
	https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar#bibliography-template
	
	""You can also override the default bibliography template, by passing 
	the --template or -T option parameter to the bibliography tag.""

<p>In the last decade, a number of frameworks started to appear that implement, directly in user-space with kernel-bypass mode, high-speed software data plane functionalities on commodity hardware. Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is one of such frameworks, representing an interesting point in the design space in that it offers: (i) in user-space networking, (ii) the flexibility of a modular router (Click and variants) with (iii) the benefits brought by techniques such as batch processing that have become commonplace in high-speed networking stacks (such as netmap or DPDK). Similarly to Click, VPP lets users arrange functions as a processing graph, providing a full-blown stack of network functions. However, unlike Click where the whole tree is traversed for each packet, in VPP each traversed node processes all packets in the batch (called \textitvector) before moving to the next node. This design choice enables several code optimizations that greatly improve the achievable processing throughput. This paper introduces the main VPP concepts and architecture, and experimentally evaluates the impact of design choices (such as batch packet processing) on performance.</p>
