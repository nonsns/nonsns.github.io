In particular, we contrast domain expert models (such as ITU-T and IQX) fed with a single QoS metric, to models trained using our ground-truth dataset over multiple QoS metrics as features. Results of our experiments show that, albeit very simple, expert models have a comparable accuracy to machine learning approaches.

<p>In-network caching is an appealing solution to cope with the increasing bandwidth demand of video, audio and data transfer over the Internet. Nonetheless, an increasing share of content delivery services adopt encryption through HTTPS, which is not compatible with traditional ISP-managed approaches like transparent and proxy caching. This raises the need for solutions involving both Internet Service Providers (ISP) and Content Providers (CP): by design, the solution should preserve business-critical CP information (e.g., content popularity, user preferences) on the one hand, while allowing for a deeper integration of caches in the ISP architecture (e.g., in 5G femto-cells) on the other hand. In this paper we address this issue by considering a contentoblivious ISP-operated cache. The ISP allocates the cache storage to various content providers so as to maximize the bandwidth savings provided by the cache: the main novelty lies in the fact that, to protect business-critical information, ISPs only need to measure the aggregated miss rates of the individual CPs and does not need to be aware of the objects that are requested, as in classic caching. We propose a cache allocation algorithm based on a perturbed stochastic subgradient method, and prove that the algorithm converges close to the allocation that maximizes the overall cache hit rate. We use extensive simulations to validate the algorithm and to assess its convergence rate under stationary and non-stationary content popularity. Our results (i) testify the feasibility of content-oblivious caches and (ii) show that the proposed algorithm can achieve within 10% from the global optimum in our evaluation.</p>

<p>This paper provides a comprehensive picture of IP-layer anycast adoption in the current Internet. We carry on multiple IPv4 anycast censuses, relying on latency measurement from PlanetLab. Next, we leverage our novel technique for anycast detection, enumeration, and geolocation to quantify anycast adoption in the Internet. Our technique is scalable and, unlike previous efforts that are bound to exploiting DNS, is protocol-agnostic. Our results show that major Internet companies (including tier-1 ISPs, over-the-top operators, Cloud providers and equipment vendors) use anycast: we find that a broad range of TCP services are offered over anycast, the most popular of which include HTTP and HTTPS by anycast CDNs that serve websites from the top-100k Alexa list. Additionally, we complement our characterization of IPv4 anycast with a description of the challenges we faced to collect and analyze large-scale delay measurements, and the lessons learned.</p>

<p>Recently, a negative interplay has been shown to arise when scheduling/AQM techniques and low-priority conges- tion control protocols are used together: namely, AQM resets the relative level of priority among congestion control protocols. This work explores this issue by (i) studying a fluid model that describes system dynamics of heterogeneous congestion control protocols competing on a bottleneck link governed by AQM and (ii) proposing a system level solution able to reinstate priorities among protocols.</p>

	-basically one each day; just dicovered that any garbage here
	(comments, white spaces, etc.) gets rendered in the final HTML	
v1 // Wed Jan 31 01:31:03 CET 2018

this bib is for my own publications.
basically redoing the format by hand.... looks nice though!

usage:
1) in _config.yml
	scholar:
  	[...]
  		bibliography_template: bib

2) however, from:	
	https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar#bibliography-template
	
	""You can also override the default bibliography template, by passing 
	the --template or -T option parameter to the bibliography tag.""

<p>In this work, we develop a distributed routing algorithm for topology discovery, suitable for ISP transport networks, that is however inspired by opportunistic algorithms used in ad hoc wireless networks. We propose a plug-and-play control plane, able to find multiple paths toward the same destination, and introduce a novel algorithm, called adaptive probabilistic flooding, to achieve this goal. By keeping a small amount of state in routers taking part in the discovery process, our technique significantly limits the amount of control messages exchanged with flooding \u2013 and, at the same time, it only minimally affects the quality of the discovered multiple path with respect to the optimal solution. Simple analytical bounds, confirmed by results gathered with extensive simulation on several topologies (up to 10,000 nodes), show our approach to be of high practical interest.</p>
