title    = { A Sliding-Resolution Algorithm for Hierarchical Graph Clustering  },
abstract = {We propose a novel algorithm for the hierarchical clustering of graphs. The algorithm is a simple but key modification of the Louvain algorithm based on some sliding-resolution scheme. In particular, the most relevant clusterings, corresponding to different resolutions, are identified. The algorithm is parameter-free and has a complexity of O(m log n) where n is the number of nodes and m the number of edges. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show the accuracy and scalability of the algorithm.

abstract = { Apple and Samsung have been fighting patent battles around the world. Come learn about the mathematics at the heart of one of these battles, the error correcting codes used in 3G communication. We will give a gentle introduction to coding theory, explain why this caused a legal battle, and we will conclude by describing why President Obama ultimately vetoed the ruling by the court (the first time a  president had used that veto power in nearly 30 years!).

title    = { An Efficient Data Protection Architecture Based on Fragmentation and Encryption },
abstract = { 
In this presentation, a completely revisited secure data storage and transmission scheme is
presented. This new scheme is based on an agnostic selective encryption methods combined
with fragmentation and dispersion. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used as the
preprocessing method to determine the selection process before encryption and to
guarantee the agnostic property of the protection. Also, General Purpose Graphic Processing
Unit (GPGPU) is deployed to allow performance to be very efficient compared with full
encryption algorithms. During the protection process, the data is fragmented to be private
fragments with small storage space and public fragments with large storage space. Then the
dispersion step will distribute the fragments to different storage environments aiming at
utilizing the convenient and inexpensive cloud storage space while provide security for the
data. This design, with practical experimentations on different hardware configurations,
provides strong level of protection and good performance at the same time plus flexible
storage dispersion schemes.  },

title    = {  Performance of Balanced Fairness in Resource Pools: A Recursive Approach },
abstract = {  Understanding the performance of a pool of servers is crucial for proper dimensioning. One of the main challenges is to take into account the complex interactions between servers that are pooled to process jobs. In particular, a job can generally not be processed by any server of the cluster due to various constraints like data locality. In this paper, we represent these constraints by some assignment graph between jobs and servers. We present a recursive approach to computing performance metrics like mean response times when the server capacities are shared according to balanced fairness. While the computational cost of these formulas can be exponential in the number of servers in the worst case, we illustrate their practical interest by introducing broad classes of pool structures that can be exactly analyzed in polynomial time. This extends considerably the class of models for which explicit performance metrics are accessible.

abstract = { 
Recent advances in mobile and wearable technologies bring new opportunities for positive computing that aims to use computing technologies to support human well-being and potential. In particular, mobile and wearable technologies help us to better understand and deal with various threats to the well-being of people, ranging from technology overuse such as productivity loss to mental problems such as stress and depression. In this talk, Iâ€™ll present some of my recent study results about leveraging mobile and wearable sensing for positive computing: (1) mobile usage data analysis to understand and identify problematic smartphone usage behaviors; (2) wearable sensor data analysis to quantify the patterns of smartwatch wearing behaviors; (3) motion sensor data analysis to infer dangerous trails for walking with crowdsensing techniques.    },

title    = {  Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Access Control with M2M/H2H traffic in LTE-A networks },
abstract = {  Although many advantages are expected from the provision of services for M2M communications in cellular networks such as extended coverage, security, robust management and lower deployment costs, coexistence with a large number of M2M devices is still an important challenge, in part due to the difficulty in allowing simultaneous access. Although the random access procedure in LTE-A is adequate for H2H communications, it is necessary to optimize this mechanism when M2M communications are considered. One of the proposed methods in 3GPP is Access Class Barring (ACB), which is able to reduce the number of simultaneous users contending for access. However, it is still not clear how to adapt its parameters in dynamic or bursty scenarios, such as those that appear when M2M communications are introduced.We propose a dynamic mechanism for ACB based on reinforcement learning, which aims to reduce the impact that M2M communications have over H2H communications, while at the same time ensuring that the KPIs for all users are in acceptable levels.
