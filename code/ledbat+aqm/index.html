      <h2 id="ledbataqm-code">LEDBAT+AQM code</h2>

<p>Nowadays, due to excessive queuing, delays on the Internet can grow longer than several round trips between the Moon and the Earth – for which the ‘‘bufferbloat’’ term was recently coined. Some point to active queue management (AQM) as the  solution. Others propose end-to-end low-priority congestion control (LPCC) true techniques  . Under both approaches, promising advances have been made in recent times: notable examples are CoDel for AQM, and LEDBAT for LPCC.  In this project, we study the impact that Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques have on LEDBAT (and other LPCCs such as NICE, TCP-LP, etc.).  To promote cross-comparison, we make our   <a href="#code"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> simulation code</a> and  <a href="#dataset"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> experimental code</a> available to the research community.</p>

<h3 id="the-phenomenon">The phenomenon</h3>

<p>While LPCC and AQM both try to solve the buffer inflation problem, however a potentially fateful interaction arise when AQM and LPCC techniques are combined true, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AQM resets the relative level of priority between best effort and low-priority congestion control protocols;</li>
  <li>while reprioritization generally equalizes the priority of LPCC  and TCP, we also find that some AQM settings may actually lead best effort TCP to starvation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is illustrated in the following figure, showing a breakdown of the TCP vs LEDBAT throughput for 10 flows sharing the same bottleneck under FIFO Droptail (left) vs RED (right).</p>

<p><img src="/drossi/assets/images/ledbat+aqm-evolution.png" alt="" title="Time evolution of per-flow throughput for heterogeneous transport protocols on FIFO vs AQM scheduling disciplines" width="500px" /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>

<p>By an extended set of experiments true  conducted on both controlled testbeds and on the Internet, we show the problem to hold in the real world for any tested combination of AQM policies and LPCC protocols. To further validate the generality of our findings, we complement our experiments with packet-level simulation, to cover cases of other popular AQM and LPCC that are not available in the Linux kernel true.</p>

<p><img src="/drossi/assets/images/lpcc+aqm-generality.png" alt="" title="Parallel coordinate plot confirming that the phenomenon is of fundamental nature and applies for every (LPCC,AQM) combination" width="500px" /></p>

<p>To gather fundamental insights on the problem</p>
<ul>
  <li>we resort to a control theoretic modeling to  analyze the system dynamics true (that was shortlisted for, but finally did not win, the best paper award  <i class="fa fa-star"></i>) that we extend in true (a little known but very cool paper!)</li>
  <li>finally, we propose true  and implement true  a solution able to  reinstate the relative levels of priority between heterogeneous congestion contro, while avoiding the bufferbloat problem  at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nowadays, due to excessive queuing, delays on the Internet can grow longer than several round trips between the Moon and the Earth, for which the "bufferbloat" term was recently coined. Some point to active queue management (AQM) as the solution. Others propose end-to-end low-priority congestion control techniques (LPCC). Under both approaches, promising advances have been made in recent times: notable examples are CoDel for AQM, and LEDBAT for LPCC. In this paper, we warn of a potentially fateful interaction when AQM and LPCC techniques are combined: namely (i) AQM resets the relative level of priority between best effort and low-priority congestion control protocols; (ii) while reprioritization generally equalizes the priority of LPCC and TCP, we also find that some AQM settings may actually lead best effort TCP to starvation. By an extended set of experiments conducted on both controlled testbeds and on the Internet, we show the problem to hold in the real world for all tested combination of AQM policies and LPCC protocols. To further validate the generality of our findings, we complement our experiments with packet-level simulation, to cover cases of other popular AQM and LPCC that are not available in the Linux kernel. To promote cross-comparison, we make our scripts and dataset available to the research community.</p>

This work explores this issue by carrying out a control-theoretic analysis of the dynamical system to prove some fundamental properties that fully characterize the reprioritization phenomenon. In particular, (i) we provide the closed-form solution of the equilibrium in the open loop (i.e., fixing a target loss probability p); (ii) we provide a stability analysis and a characterization of the reprioritization phenomenon when closing the loop with AQM (i.e., that dynamically adjusts the system loss probability). Our results are important as the characterization of the reprioritization phenomenon is not only quantitatively accurate for the specific protocols and AQM considered but also qualitatively accurate for a broader range of congestion control protocol and AQM combinations. Finally, while we find a sufficient condition to avoid the reprioritization phenomenon, we also show, at the same time, such conditions to be likely impractical: Therefore, we propose a simple and practical system-level solution that is able to reinstate priorities among protocols. </p>
